	OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,	the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I'd do some more tests.		First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than	realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a	version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).	I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results	(for better or for worse).		I pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TV	a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where	the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized	a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space	station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between	frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only	5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.		I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot	card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then	imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,	keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled	to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default	"2.00" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten	frames.		I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "Raw Speed Test" program I used	for the results I'd been reporting earlier.			That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short	test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard	disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate	was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk	(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.		I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional	scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240	size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who	observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in	action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's	entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...		Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.		The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with	"preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played	from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).	A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was	very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with	ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this	much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task	switching.		A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see	any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight	stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.		I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the	key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also	improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance	even more...

Well, it beats a 32-bit design for thee sake of ellegance.	48 bit means 16 bits per primary colour.	The 2^48 nr of colours is a bit misleading. It makes more sense to see it	as 65536 possible shades of pure red.	This might actually make some sense, since 256 shades of red (24 bit colours) 	may produce visible 'jumps' in intensity.	Then again, a byte per primary colour for each pixel is the most elegant way 	of doing colour graphics, because it leaves ya such a tidy (and fast) program	code.

The first and only thing I've ever tried to auto-trace was a piece	of a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2.  I wanted to get the	outline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneously	suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.  I	suspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastline	very irregular, but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines	(not only lattitude and longitude, but loran grids as well).  The most	common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and	tangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead of	the coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive	algorithm that would let you step in and say "no, dummy, you're going the	wrong way".			Steve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did his	doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii).	A good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized	micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles.	This is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with	its auto-trace tool.			In some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since he	was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a	good centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all future	analysis depended.  However, in other respects, it was an easier problem	since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the	virus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could be	restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight,	clean, and well imaged; you don't always have that freedom auto-tracing real	life images.  In any case, it gave me some insight into just how difficult	this problem is to solve in the general case.			(*) Steve is no longer with us.  He and his wife disappeared while	on vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated.  Their last	known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area.  While no	bodies were ever found, they are presumed to have been the victim of some	sort of fall or accident in the woods.	-- 	Roy Smith <roy@nyu.edu>	Hippocrates Project, Department of Microbiology, Coles 202	NYU School of Medicine, 550 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016	"This never happened to Bart Simpson."

Of course the chances of		Ok It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics 	that you are looking for. I think you may have left out a few 	important parameters. 	The polygons are all convex. 	They have less than N sides. (you are drawing meshes walls doors etc.)		I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex	polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw	concave / self intersecting polygons. 	This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that 	simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line.	Complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier.		The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small 	number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made.		Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for	code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex	polygons.  		>finding something like that are pretty remote, so I guess I'd need the source	>with it.

Find a copy of "Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display" by	Paul Heckbert, SIGGRAPH '82 Proceedings, page 297.  There are other	algorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple.  Implementations	are included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).		A variant method is described in "Graphics Gems", p. 287-293.  Note that	the code from the "Graphics Gems" series is all available from an FTP site,	as described above.		Check out John Bradley's "Diversity Algorithm", which is incorporated into	the xv package and described in the back of the manual.		The ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another	quantizing algorithm which is presented as "doing a better job than the	other algorithms, but slower".		There's also an implementation of:		Wan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data	Clustering_, Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 #2 (June, 1988),	pp. 153-162.		avialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar.  This code,	in modified form, appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well.			4) Converting color into grayscale.		The NTSC formula is:		    luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue			5) Quantizing grayscale to black&white.		The only reference you need for this stuff is:		    Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN 0-262-21009-6		But before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulation	software mentioned in item 7 below.  All of the packages mentioned can do	some form of gray to b&w conversion.			6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.		The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source	image, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination.	This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead,	loop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse*	transformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source.	This method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one	2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doing	sub-pixel sampling.		However, there is a much faster method, with antialising included,	which involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originally	created for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is	also present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: "A Fast Algorithm for Raster	Rotation", by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics	Interface '86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears in	the same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appears	in "Graphics Gems" (see section [1]) under the original title.			7) Free image manipulation software.		There are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to	another, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus	the above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions.	Here are pointers to some of them:		    xv by John Bradley.  X-based image display, manipulation, and format	    conversion package.

There are a number of automated mail servers that will	send you things like this in response to a message.  See item 13 below for	details on some.		Also, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion	of software like this.  You may find useful information there.			8) Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc.		You almost certainly don't need these.  Read the above item 7 on free	image manipulation software.  Get one or more of these packages and	look through them.  Chances are excellent that the image converter you	were going to write is already there.  But if you still want one of the	format documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from	zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.		These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct.	This archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object	formats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as Mark	Hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.		A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained	by Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  The latest version exists at	ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats.  Apparently,	neither of these is complete, you might want to check both.		FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It's a file format most	often used in astronomy.  Despite the name, it can contain not only images	but other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and	information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.				9) Converting between vector formats.		A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw	to CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a very	different problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting	one image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you	get past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects	are the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats.	The basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled	round-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another.	Except in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do	a one-to-one conversion between vector formats.		There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The	contributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac.	A better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.		On the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,	rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.	As far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such	converters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been	posted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive	site.		A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format	to a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to	X11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for	PC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also,	the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's X11/NeWs can	be used to render to a file if you're clever.  But in general, the	answer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector to	vector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be	trivial.		GNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes	drivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as	a PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implements	essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript	and level 2).			10) How to get Pixar films.		The various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are available	on video tape.  You can order them from Direct Cinema Limited:		    Film                           Individual Price      Institutional Price	    Luxo, Jr.				$14.95			$50.00	    Red's Dream				$19.95			$75.00	    Tin Toy				$24.95			$75.00	    Knickknack				$24.95			$75.00	    Luxo, Jr./Red's Dream/Tin Toy	$39.95			$100.00		All tapes are on 1/2" VHS NTSC.  Add $10/tape for PAL format.  Also	available:		    Tin Toy T-shirt			$15.00	    Knickknack 3D T-shirt		$15.00 (includes glasses)		For individual orders, add $5 S&H for the first tape or shirt, $2 for	each additional tape or shirt.  For institutional orders, add $5 S&H	for the first tape, $3 for each additional tape.  Foreign shipping, add	$3/tape or shirt.  Call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international,	213-396-3233 FAX) to charge to your credit card.  Call first to verify	prices and availability.  Or, just write to:		    Direct Cinema Limited	    1749 14th Street	    Santa Monica, CA 90404-4342		Allan Braunsdorf has this to say:		At SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts	for $25.  That was a sale price.  You can get it for slightly	more than that normally.  ($35 maybe.)  I believe it's	available from RenderMan Retail (at Pixar's address).		    Pixar	    1001 West Cutting Blvd.	    Richmond, CA. 94804	    (510) 236-4000 	    (510) 236-0388 (FAX)		You can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains "Luxo, Jr.", "Red's	Dream", "Tin Toy" and "Knicknack" for $25.00, plus $2.50 for shipping. They	will take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card. I 	ordered mine just last week and received it several days later. Don't expect 	to be able to rent a copy from your local video store. According to the license	agreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented.			11) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier (or B-spline) curve?		The short answer is, "You can't."  Unless you use a rational spline you	can only approximate a circle.  The approximation may look acceptable,	but it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of	approximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not	visible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to	do the job right, consult the article:		  "A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles"	  by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller	  in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,	  September, 1989, pages 48-56.		For rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:		  Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture	  by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt,	  Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980.		For the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article:		  "Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves"	  by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken	  in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined),	  June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]			12) How to order standards documents.		The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also	ISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900,	mailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the	complete name and number.		Some useful numbers to know:		CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical	Kernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer's Hierarchical	Interactive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSI	Y14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers;	for example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.		Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit	comments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can let	you know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering	at 1-800-854-7179.			13) How to FTP by email.		There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups	and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message	to an automated server saying something like "send comp.sources.unix/fbm",	and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.		In addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to	ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying "help" and it will tell you how to use	it.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.			14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.		Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to	infinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,	the point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of	edges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior	hole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in	the trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines' article in	Glassner's ray tracing book (above) for more information, including	treatment of special cases.		Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all	the vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside,	if the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about an	order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the	trigonometric functions is usually quite costly.		Code for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in	the Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu:	pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.			15) How to tessellate a sphere.		One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  The	base of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides	each triangle into four smaller ones.  Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu>	has posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates.	It's available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.		16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination.		Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography:		Highlights of this edition-		    i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through	       November '91;	    ii) papers from all Siggraph, Graphics Interface, Eurographics, CG	        International and Ausgraph proceedings through December, '91;	    iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup;	    iv) cross-indices by keyword and author;	    v)  glossary of the 119 keywords used.		The bib is in the form of a PostScript file.  The printout is 41 pages long.	Below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file. It's named	"speer.raytrace.bib.ps.Z" and is compressed at most sites-		             Site                             Dir		wuarchive.wustl.edu	graphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/		karazm.math.uh.edu	pub/Graphics/		gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au	pub/papers/		nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/graphics		coral.cs.jcu.edu.au     graphics/papers/		Eric Haines (erich@eye.com) maintains ray tracing and radiosity/global	illumination bibliographies.  These are in "refer" format, and so can be	searched electronically (a simple awk script to search for keywords is	included with each).  The bibliographies are available at most of the	sites listed above, and the most current versions are maintained at		Tom Wilson (wilson@cs.ucf.edu) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray	tracing related research papers and books.  The information is essentially	in plaintext, and Latex and troff formatting programs are included.  This	collection is available at most of the sites above as "rtabs.*".		17) SIGGRAPH information online		[from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick]		ACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information site at  siggraph.org	(128.248.245.250).  This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via both	anonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server.		The anonymous ftp service is very standard, and the ftp directory includes	both conference and publications subdirectories.		To retrieve information by electronic mail, send mail to	     archive-server@siggraph.org	and in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send	followed by the topic and subtopic you wish.  A good place to start is with	the command	     send index	which will give you an up-to-date list of available information.			18) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available		[from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd]		ACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH '91 Panels Proceedings	at the  siggraph.org  site (128.248.245.250).  The proceedings are available	in three formats:	     text   (ASCII)	     rtf    (rich text format, suitable for many word processors)	     word   (MS Word for the Macintosh)	They may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways:		(1) by anonymous ftp	    change to one of the directories	       publications/s91/panels_proceedings/[text|rtf|word]	    The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode, while the word	    files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary 	    mode.		    Each directory contains a Table of Contents file (TOC) that describes the	    contents of each panel file.		(2) by electronic mail	    send mail to	       archive-server@siggraph.org	    You can retrieve either the  text  or  rtf  files.  We suggest that you	    first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages	       send panel91-txt index	       send panel91-rtf index	    in the subject or body of the message.  You will get the necessary	    information to retrieve the actual transcript files.			19) Graphics mailing lists		There are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there, each	covering either a single product or a single topic.  I have been an	active participant in one of these for some time now, and find the	focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic	to be nothing short of amazing.		Please send me the appropriate information if you have any others you	would like to see added.

Comments - 26 formats, no software	      (this is good, IMHO - I prefer books which are non-platform-dependent).	      Questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us.			21) What about GIF?		GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format.  It is portable and usable upon	a wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes, the	keeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don't like	it much.  However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question	which was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a list	of newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.			alt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals,		alt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answers		Available in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp from	pit-manager.mit.edu in the files:		/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1	/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2		Also available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail	message containing any or all of:		send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1	send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2		Send a message containing "help" to get general information about the	mail server.		Also, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and	20 above for more information.			22) What is morphing?		Warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new	location. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one.	Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and	morphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au	in the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:		        morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M)	        morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)	        m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)		The files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and	uncompress them afterwards.			23) How to ray-trace height fields		Height fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses,	such as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  Thus, they	get their own FAQ section.  Note that further references can no doubt be	located via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.		The following paper seems to be the definitive reference:		F. Kenton Musgrave	Grid Tracing: Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields	July, 1988	<musg88.ps.Z>		This is available as "Research Report YALEU/DCS/RR-639" from Yale University,	it's also in the SIGGRAPH '91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics and	Imaging course notes, and (best of all) it's available on the net:		    nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/musg88.ps.Z	    weedeater.math.yale.edu	pub/Papers/musg88.ms.Z	    princeton.edu		pub/Graphics/Papers/musg88.ms.Z	    coral.cs.jcu.edu.au		graphics/papers/musg88.ps.Z	    gondwana.ecr.mu.OZ.AU	pub/papers/musg88.ms.Z and musg88.ps.Z		An implementation of this paper may be found in Rayshade.

Somewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank.	Fill it out and mail it in.  ACM membership for students costs $23.00,	Voting or Associate Membership $77.00 (yearly)		SIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional $16.00, $26.00 for	Voting or Associate Members (also yearly).  To get TOG (Transactions	on Graphics) it's another $26.00 for students and $31.00 for Voting or	Associate Members.		If you just want to join SIGGRAPH without joining ACM, it'll cost you	$59.00 (no student discount).		There are surcharges for overseas airmailing of publications.		ACM Member services may be contacted via email at acmhelp@acmvm.bitnet. 	Their phone number is (212) 626-0500.  FAX number (212) 944-1318.

	I am looking for a small utility that will convert a Microsoft Video (AVI)	file to an Autodesk Animator Pro (FLC) file. Since AVIs also contain sound,	it would be nice if this utility also stored the sound track as a WAV or VOC	file. Currently I'm accomplishing this by saving the AVI as multiple DIBs	using Video for Windows, then converting each DIB to a GIF, then loading the	GIFs into Animator. For the sound, I load the original AVI into WavEdit and	save it as a seperate WAV file. This requires too many steps to be productive.		Any help will be GREATLY appreciated.

		A good reason (which is why many companies use it) for 48 bits / pixel	is so you can use double buffering (for animating scenes) - i.e. you have	2 * 24-bit planes. You write to the one in the background, and then FLIP! 	-- the entire screen updates to the second image-plane.

I'm sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way. If you	wanted to provide a full network connection to Linux over a modem would you	use SLIP/PPP or would you invent some new way?

	I have a question about recursive, backward raytracing.		When an incident ray (I) strikes an object at point P, first	the normal (N) is calculated. Light rays are calculated (L1 to Ln 	where n is the number of light sources) - these being the light	rays that do not intersect with anything. The reflected ray (R) and	the transmitted ray (T) is calculated from the formulae.		Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours 	along the rays (R and T) as rCol and tCol. Each object has its own	colour oCol and each light source has liCol (1 <= i <= n).		The question is: 	  How do you combine rCol, tCol, oCol and all the liCol's to get	  the correct resulting colour to return along the I ray?		All colours are defined as strucures (records) having r, g, b components	between 0 and 1.		If anyone has done this before could you give me a few hints?		--	Adrian Secchia		asecchia@cs.uct.ac.za

G'day Brian,		I'll be blunt about this.

There is also a somewhat muddled explanation in the first edition	of Newman and Sproull.		The algorithm described in PECG runs in near linear time.		Luck,		Dave Rogers

The exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections:  The Vatican	Library, Archaeology, Humanism, Mathematics, Music, Medicine &	Biology, Nature Described, A Wider World I: How the Orient Came	to Rome, and A Wider World II: How Rome Went to China.  Each	section consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit	directory and contains the exhibit text for that section and	separate JPEG image files for each object.  This online exhibit	includes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit,	but also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used if	there were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items	omitted later in the planning process.

I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel	of 12 bits for computational precision. More than that would seem to be wasted.		Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to	represent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding.		Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component)	frame buffers. This set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d picture	to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previous	frame) is displayed. This makes for smoother animation.		>(sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC 5000/25.  Sigh.)		Well hey if you want to brag about numbers, the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+	card with 96 bits per pixel. Full double buffering (Two 24 bit buffers), a 24	bit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage.

	Dear Netters:			I am looking for C source code to test if a 3D point lies within a		concave polyhadra. I have read a few articles about this and know		that two solutions exist: parity counting and angle sumation. Both			ideas are pretty simple but coding is not. So I wonder if there exists		public domain source code for this.		    Another 'rough' solition (don't care special cases) is ray-casting		which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces		consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used	(M. Tamminen, et. al., 1984. "Ray-casting and block model conversion	using a spatial index". Computer-Aided-Designs. 4, 1984, 60-65).	But the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their	normal pointing outside of polyhedra. How this could be done in practice ?	I have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. How could I ensure their	normals pointing outside the polyhedra ? The paper mentioned above assumed	this is already the case.			   I have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden	line removal. It says "if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing		toward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra...". Again how to make	sure ?			   Any pointers are welcome ?

			Anyone who thinks that TIFF is too complex hasn't dealt with		CGM, ASN.1, CDA, DCA, SGML, or any one of a number of other		very successful file format.  People seem perfectly capable		dealing with these others.  Dealing with the format of TIFF		is frankly less difficult than dealing with the DCT, LZW, and		FAX encoding of the image data.  The majority of the libraries		which deal with TIFF are dedicated to these other issues rather		than with simply decoding the tags and parameters.			Perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather		simpleminded formats such as GIF, PCX, and BMP, but to suggest		that TIFF is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous.			That doesn't mean that GIF isn't fine, but don't even thing about		using it in many instances.  GIF is very nice for use in low-end		photos applications and for screen grabs and such, but it would		never do for high-volume or high-resolution systems.  FAX is nice,		but it doesn't do color (and GIF doesn't do B&W all that well).		JPEG is nice for high-resolution color, but is slow for low-end.			The advantage TIFF brings to the table is its ability to handle		all these situations (and then some).  Naturally it's more complex.		But I'ld rather propose TIFF imaging solutions over imaging		systems based on having to deal with 3-4 file formats anyday.			You may find that TIFF is too complicated for your personal tastes		but please don't wrail against it's complexity.  The complexity		it contains is required to provide the functionality it does and		doesn't come close to the complexity found in most commercially		viable file formats.				If we're in philosophical arguments against complexity, let's all		go program in scheme and forth and do imaging with run length		encoding.

The reflected	| ray (R) and the transmitted ray (T) is calculated from the formulae.	| 	| Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours 	| along the rays (R and T) as rCol and tCol.

First of all (this is NOT a snide response), if you're confused about	this issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well.  I suggest	that the weakness is your reference material.  Get "An Introduction to Ray	Tracing" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing	algorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.		    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up	all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For	example, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up	and clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower	bound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that's another issue =^).  So, you	get some illumination equation like this:		        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent		    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light	intensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less	hand-waving illumination equation is this:		        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt		    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the	material constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from	transparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a	purple-colored glass object.		    Hopefully this answers your question.  I'll forward my "illumination	equation sermon" to you also.		______________________________________________________________________________	Steve Hollasch                                   Kubota Pacific Computer, Inc.	hollasch@kpc.com                                 Santa Clara, California

      --- Scientific Visualization of Chemical Systems ---	 	           Cornell Theory Center Summer School	 	          Offered through the Cornell School of	        Continuing Education and Summer Sessions	 	                  Course Description	 	 Within the past ten years, the  simulation and  modeling of		molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into	a  international  industry. Computer  graphics has played  a	decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to	build, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.	 	While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their	own discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology,	simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists.	Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms	and technological advances in graphical computing.	 	This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap	between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry	researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of	prepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to	be a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets	from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students	will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercises	and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming	(IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will have	access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including video	recording equipment.	 	           sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art	           computer graphics into their research; computer scientists	           wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of	           scientific visualization.	 	           The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a	           first-come first-served basis.	 	           without credit as a workshop. Calculus, linear algebra	           and introductory chemistry required. Familiarity with Unix,	           X-windows and C is useful but not required.	 	        June 14-18, 1993  (1 or 0 credits)	 	 	        2 credits           $820	 	Format	 	The course will be held in the Theory Center training facility	where computer workstations will be available.  Daily lectures will be	interspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided	for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing	environment. Students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis	of their laboratory exercises and short final project. Those enrolled	for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures, be given	more time for project development and meet daily to share experience	and discuss problems encountered.	 	Content (may vary)	 	    Elements of computer graphics	         polygonal rendering, lighting models, ray tracing, volumetric	         rendering, stereo graphics, animation, introduction to data-flow	         programming (DX), interactivity.	 	    Representing the atom	         size, time and energy scales	         basic classical and quantum mechanics	 	    Important categories of molecules	         small molecules, biopolymers, surfaces and catalysts,	         miscellaneous current applications	 	    Data formats and conversions	 	    Advanced molecular graphics techniques	 	    Types of simulation and experiment	         electronic structure, molecular dynamics/mechanics	         electrostatics, X-ray crystallography, NMR, quantum	         dynamics and spectroscopy.	 	Instructors	 	The course will be taught by two instructors.

It's appreciated that you will use Archie	before asking help in the newsgroups.		Archie servers:	  archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie/NZ)	  archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland/Eur.)	  archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)	  cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)	  archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN)	  archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (Korea)	  archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24  (TWN)	  archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7  (UK/Ireland)	  archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179    (USA [MD])	  archie.unl.edu (password: archie1)    (USA [NE])	  archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2         (USA [NY])	  archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15     (USA [NJ])	  archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)		Connect to Archie server with telnet and type "archie" as username.	To get help type 'help'.	You can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie	without the burden of a telnet session.	'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc,	vol. 27.		To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with	subject "help" to "archie" account at any of above sites.		(Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is	accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000].	Connect to it and specify "archie" as the host name and "archie" as	the username.)		==========================================================================		2. Notes	========	(Excerpted from the FAQ article)		Please do *not* post or mail messages saying "I can't FTP, could	someone mail this to me?"  There are a number of automated mail servers	that will send you things like this in response to a message.		There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups	and make them available via an email query system.

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes	===========================================		Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help.	Don't overuse mail servers.		There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these	mail servers have a command like	   path a_valid_return_e-mail_address	to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.		DEC's FTPMAIL	-------------	  Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,	  and having a line containing the word 'help'.	  You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you	  must follow in order to get the files you want.		  Note that the "reply" or "answer" command in your mailer will not work	  for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send	  requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.	  Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com	  address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not	  responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.		BITFTP	------	  For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.

Despite its small size and quickness,	  it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:	  standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots,	  mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or	  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each	  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually	  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are	  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four	  different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and	  other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.	  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),	  including a portable metafile format and renderer.	  	  Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on	  hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot	  	  At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:	  	  Unix:   SunOS, A/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG/UX, Ultrix	  Other platforms: VMS, Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, NeXT	  	  Authors: Many.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display	==========================================================		PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)	======================		IMDISP	------	  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,	  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS	  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions	  [PC and Macs]		LabVIEW 2	---------	  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a	  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the	  "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.	  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a	  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the	  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and	  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any	  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real	  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual	  instrument.		  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)	  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time	  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for	  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The	  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block	  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming	  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:	  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters	  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C	  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual	  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.		  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an	  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level	  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level	  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.		  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has	  utility functions for memory management data communications and	  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for	  the development of custom code.)		Ultimage Concept VI	-------------------	  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual	  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end	  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.	  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory	  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,	  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,	  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.		  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further	  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of	  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and	  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical	  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and	  characterization.		  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel	  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and	  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can	  be imported.		  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial	  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic	  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological	  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole	  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.	  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and	  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of	  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and	  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The	  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom	  modules.		  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity	  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can	  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight	  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging	  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are	  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local	  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.	  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as	  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)	  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening	  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.		  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even	  hole filling.		  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,	  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.		  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494	  707-579-1733		IPLab Spectrum	--------------	  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the	  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by	  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user	  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far	  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool	  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a	  movie command for cycling through windows.			Macintosh-based tools	=====================		NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more	---------------------------------	  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the	  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results	  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,	  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from	  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been	  developed by Spyglass.

It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,	  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting	  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of	  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined	  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw	  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also	  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,	  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with	  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS	  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.	  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted	  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For	  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from	  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,	  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include	  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation	  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to	  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,	  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.		  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard	  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,	  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe	  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,	  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,	  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..		  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA	  94039-7900 415-961-4400		ColorStudio and ImageStudio	---------------------------	  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has	  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and	  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to	  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The	  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can	  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a	  variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool"	  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close	  hues, color range and mask.

Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283		Digital Darkroom	----------------	  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and	  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to	  select part of an image simply by "painting" it. A new polyline	  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide	  selections.  A brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion	  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.	  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale	  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as	  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.

It has	  the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image	  enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and	  unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There	  is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write	  your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however	  Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in	  the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching	  tool and it is very good for this purpose."		  "Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its	  development phase.. i.e. it doesn't have all the inbuilt features of	  other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt	  language for writing "programs" for processing an image, defining	  convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down	  menus etc... It is unprotected software."		  Process Software Solutions, PO Box 2110, Wollongong, New South Wales,	  Australia. 2500. Phone 61 42 261757  Fax 61 42 264190.		Enhance	-------	  Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally	  provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter	  variations: "Laplacian, medium noise filter", etc.  Files can be saved	  as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).		  MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109		Image Analyst	-------------	  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative	  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure	  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the	  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such	  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video	  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in	  radiographs.		  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video	  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of	  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine	  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature	  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst	  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or	  a disk-stored image.		  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user	  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.	  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically	  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.	  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and	  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and	  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR	  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.		  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence	  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user	  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)	  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the	  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,	  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and	  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so	  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also	  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu	  (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)	  Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,	  VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,	  or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)	  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),	  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building	  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.	     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is	  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy	  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a	  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything	  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.	  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based	  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware	  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and	  can do image arithmetic, etc.	    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is	  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and	  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.	     There is currently a project - "AIPS++" - underway to rewrite the	  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an	  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for	  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be	  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with	  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and	  Australia to name a few.

DISIMP	------	  (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful	  system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in	  interactive times.		  Feature Description		  DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and	  spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the	  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image	  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that	  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of	  modules.		  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and	  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and	  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and	  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and	  ratioing.		  Host Configuration Requirements		  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more	  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.	  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using	  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific	  applications programs.		  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick	  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,	  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be	  interactively driven through this control.		  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of	  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of	  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential	  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be	  added to further enhance referenced imagery.		  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels	  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help	  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The	  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional	  processing of remote sensed data.

Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,	  automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to	  byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically	  and carefree.		  It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that	  difficult to write your own with their programmer's module.		  Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for	  a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000	  with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display"		HIPS	----	(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)		  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image	  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image	  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil	  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of	  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has	  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well	  as a huge user-contributed library.		  Feature description		  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide	  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,	  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images	  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.		  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image	  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform	  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital	  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image	  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs	  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task	  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows	  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users	  become effective using HIPS on their first day.		  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in	  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been	  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines	  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and	  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX	  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual	  pages, and on-line documentation.		  Host Configuration Requirements		  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents	  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing	  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating	  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation	  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.	  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and	  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.	  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and	  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and	  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a	  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun	  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X	  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an	  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS	  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with	  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-	  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices	  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.		  Availability		  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an	  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It	  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS	  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or	  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of	  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]		  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives	  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in	  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional	  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS	  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary	  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-	  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer	  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the	  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision	  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in	  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire	  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize	  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data	  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value	  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time	  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of	  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of	  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other 	  palettes can be generated.			Supported functions include such niceties as the following:		o  image & image: + - / * interpolation	o  image & constant: + - / *	o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,	   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.	o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or	   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.	o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,	   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp	   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine	  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).	  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and	  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as	  polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask	  Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.	  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.	  (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to	  compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.		NCAR data	---------	  NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of	  terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at	  various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.	  This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending	  on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,	  IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive	  is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,	  email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.		UNC data tapes with voxel data	--------------	  There are 2 "public domain" tapes with data for the comparison and	  testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT	  scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.	  (softlab@cs.unc.edu)		  The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from	  omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD		NASA	----	  Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data	  from various space missions, eg.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles	=========================================		 First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP	list above.		24-bit scanning:	----------------	  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for	  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :	  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll	  house supplies.	  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have	  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.		Books with textures:	--------------------	  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.	  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also	  a wide variety of stock art is available.	  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,	  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.		  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books	  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your	  graphics work. Their address is:		Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,		00196 Rome Italy,		Piazzale Flaminio, 19		Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60		Texture Libraries:	------------------	a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit	   textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit	   TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume	   (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.

Introduction to rendering algorithms	========================================		a. Ray-Tracing:	---------------		  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read	  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would	  suggest:	   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press	     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4	  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong	  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines	  (erich@eye.com)		There's a more concise reference also:		  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: "An Introduction to Ray Tracing", in	  "Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,	  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.		It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.		b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)	--------------------------		A good reference is:		        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,	        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.		c. Others:	----------	???	[ More info is needed -- nfotis ]		========================================================================		15. Where can I find the geometric data for the:	================================================		a. Teapot ?	-----------		"Displays on Display" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole	story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has	the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe	model of the teapot.		IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column "Jim Blinn's Corner" describes	an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for	example are used.		The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get	them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at	a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).	The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a	tessellation at any specified resolution.		b. Space Shuttle ?	------------------		Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle	datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):		model1:	A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)		406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)	389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).	Payload doors non-existent.		Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He	said there is no proprietary information associated with it.		model2:	The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in		gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo	hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data		model3:	The triangles' model.		This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.		Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did	not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.		model4:	The NASA model.		The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,	defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:		<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>		From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions		3473 vertices.	2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,	 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,	 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).	Payload doors closed.		Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model	Proprietary info: unknown		model5:	The old shuttle model.		The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.		104 vertices.	452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).	Payload doors open.		We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for	some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor	Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.		========================================================================		16. Image annotation software	=============================		a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in	  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored	  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a	  rasterfile.		b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some	  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not	  sure exactly what they are.	  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.		c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)	  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats	  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert	  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.	  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu	  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)		d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).	  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all	  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.		e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output	  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.		f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based	  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host	  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and	  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based	  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,	  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed	  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation	  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).	  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for	  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.		  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not	  be redistributed without permission.		  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that	  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of	  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging	  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.		g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the 	  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen 	  color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many	  of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as	  export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest	  X11 archive.		========================================================================		17.

This was	  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working	  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL	  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I	  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general	  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.	  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose	  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I	  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh	  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image	  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've	  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best	  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large	  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a	  freebie if you want it"		  "My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,	  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its	  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It	  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing	  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even	  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH	  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which	  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use	  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical	  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,	  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image	  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity	  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve	  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)	===================================================		GRASS	-----	  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army	  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and	  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a	  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,	  although it is reported to have significant image processing	  capabilities.		  Feature Descriptions		  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the	  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source	  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass	  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using	  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who	  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very	  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software." A first review  of	  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel	  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose	  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in	  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the	  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric	  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective	  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus	  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them	  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68		  Host Configuration Requirements		  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh	  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for	  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC	  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,	  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster	  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it	  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented	  in raster (grid-cell) form.		  Availability		  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:	  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).		  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to	  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.		  This location will be the new "canonical" source for GRASS software, as	  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.	  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and	  "tar" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John	  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,	  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review	  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently	  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be	  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu		  Support		  Listserv mailing lists:		  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level	  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send	  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.		  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level	  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation	  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to	  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.

Microstation Imager	-------------------	  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS	  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager	  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a	  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.		  Feature Description		  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.	  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a	  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).	  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.	  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering	  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,	  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages	  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band	  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.		  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle	  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available	  for GIS applications.	  Host Configuration Requirements		  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)	  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software	  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.		PCI	---	  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes	  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of	  remote sensing data in eight or ten different "industry standard"	  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I	  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix	  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly	  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.		  The "PCI software" consists of several classes/groups/packages of	  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common "PCI	  database" disk file.  The "Tape I/O" package is a set of utility	  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape	  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the "PCI database" file;	  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can	  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several	  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap	  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type	  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically	  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and	  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.	  "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and	  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't	  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your	  particular application/interest calls for.		  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from	  a common "parameter file" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your "default	  directory."  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same	  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting	  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a	  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to	  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,	  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also	  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's	  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled	  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI	  data structures (database file, parameter file).		  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but	  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the	  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle	  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a	  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the	  Macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different	  "interleave" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the	  graphic-arts industry's "CT2T" format, would probably (I haven't tried)	  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT	  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start	  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI "database" file is designed to	  contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map	  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of	  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often	  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,	  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this	  can go into the PCI "database").		  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX	  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific	  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to	  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would	  display directly from a PCI "database" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus	  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be "overkill"	  in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end"	  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice	  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's	  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which	  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe	  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these	  areas.		SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)	--------------------------------	  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis	  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.

	I'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low	apparent precision in Z-buffering, that I've encountered in 2 different	PEX implementations.  I can't find any discussion of this problem in any	resources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins's	_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors' documentation).		I'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the	same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on	comp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,	hence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and	are interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in	comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach	to dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above	Gaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)		The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize "stitching"	artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are	coplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will	differ slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values	across an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with	vertices of the area.  Because of this, it's a tossup whether the	Z-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.	Visually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the	line is supposed to be solid.		Using the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly	different PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one	for the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-	mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in	effect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The	result is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to	attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.		This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used	in the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair "backwards" (i.e.	smaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view	table entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed	to NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than	if it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.		I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount	to a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,	typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).	Therefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC	between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix	the stitching.		But in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003	to 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it's worst when the NPC Z	component of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more	or less edge-on to the viewer.)  It's as if only 8 or 9 bits of the	Z-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one	problem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines "show through"	areas which they are supposed to lie behind.		I've observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital	workstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test	program demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation;	this version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX	5.1.		Open questions:	    (1) Why does this happen?	        --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?	        --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines	            as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which	            could be corrected for?	        --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their	            interpolators?	        --  Something else?	    (2) What to do about it?	        --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision	            in Z-buffered HLHSR?	        --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching	            artifacts?	        --  Am I just out of luck?

Well for starters, why use rle files?  You might have a specific program that	needs them, OK, but I tend to convert straight to jpeg format, thus a 2.4meg	24bit targa file becomes a ~80k or less 24bit jpeg.		The latest versions of XV (2.2.1 ?) and xloadimage (3.03) both handle jpeg files.	And the best way to convert to jpeg is with the c/djpeg suit.  Even at 90%	quality (you can't see the difference) the jpeg is way smaller than anything	else even an 8bit gif!

		Okay, I got enough replies about the Kubota Kenai/Denali systems that I	will post a summary of their capabilities.  I haven't actually used one	or seen one, so take the specs with a grain of salt.  I'd like to see	an independent review of one against, say, an SGI Indigo Extreme or	something.

	Greetings this is a general call for information regarding Image	Processing. I am looking for any material related to the field, and am	also trying to get my hands on some easy to use packages related to the	field. In particular source code for general use packages.		I already have several texts on the subject, but would appreciate more	input from people more knowledgable in the field than myself. I'm not	mathematically literate (ie. I don't have a degree in mathematics), so	any material that is suggested I would prefer that it was not	mathematically intensive.		The best book I have found on the subject at the moment is:		"Practical Digital Image Processing"	by Rhys Lewis	Published by Ellis Horwood (c)1990.		Likewise I am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrate	Image Processing techniques. So far I have 'xv', and 'khoros' for Unix.	'Dcview 2.1' for the IBM PC, and various related smatterings of C code	to help describe topics like, contrasting, dithering, image enhancement	via convolution etc.		If anyone could kindly supply me with some public domain software	pertinent to this area, or better still if they could tell me where I am	most likely to find it on the AARNET (Internet). If I can I would prefer	source code in C or Turbo Pascal that includes some Image Processing	code/algorithms, that I can readily alter/manipulate for the purposes of	demonstration it would be most helpful.		All the above information will contribute to my post-graduate studies,	and will be liberally used in my paper, and seminar on the subject.

First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than	   realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a	   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).	   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results	   (for better or for worse).		   I pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TV	   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where	   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized	   a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space	   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between	   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only	   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.		   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot	   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then	   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,	   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled	   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default	   "2.00" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten	   frames.		   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "Raw Speed Test" program I used	   for the results I'd been reporting earlier.		   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.		   That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short	   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard	   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate	   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk	   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.		   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional	   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240	   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who	   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in	   action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's	   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...		   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.		   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with	   "preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played	   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).	   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was	   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with	   ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this	   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task	   switching.		   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see	   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight	   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.		   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the	   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also	   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance	   even more...

(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for "double size" scaling, other scaling	factors hit peformance much harder).		(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices	to advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I'm not sure about Premiere).		Any combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size	is, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also	make a real difference.

Exactly...		I didn't want to mess with tga or rle.  So I wrote the following script. 	All you need is the very standard set of pbm utilities. 		This script is a .pov to .jpg converter.  Just run it like this:		  pov2jpg 1280 1024 fred.pov 		You will need to modify the path's in the script to reflect where you put	povray and its include files.

Well, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by	Compuserve back in 1987(?) or so.  It was to create a format that could be	read and displayed by any system.  GIF is limited to 8 bit color but has	a built in compression scheme (LZW?).		IFF is not really a graphics format, but rather a standard way to package	images, sounds, animations, text, or whatever into one file.  IFF was	created by Electronic Arts, I do believe (I could be wrong), for the Amiga.	It was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga.	The most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM (InterLeaved	BitMap?) but many others exist.  This format supports 24 bit color images.		Information on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at	zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in the directory /pub/graphics.formats	(Taken from the FAQ for this news group.)  :)		Wayne Rigby	rigby@cs.unr.edu

	hi netters,			I'm doing a project which is about image analysis.  Firstly, I	have to find out any restrictions or limitations on the colour display	on various kind of workstations, they are DECstation, HP, Amiga, Apollo.			Secondly, I read from some graphic texts that image is displayed	in 24 bites(please point out to me if I got it wrong).  But, the images	which I will deal with are displayed in 16 bites by the software they	are using currently.  So, will there be any problems to display them	under X-windows in the future? Because we are thinking to implement the	GUI by X-windows for our project				Is there any person here can help me to solve the problem or	query above?  Or, give me some advice or suggestion where I can find	them out. 			Please send me an e-mail if there are any.  Thanks in advance.

Don't have anything on that or the CEL format.		Well, I dived in feet first and reverse engineered the .PRJ file as much	as I needed to - extracted the mapping icon information - which is	when it dawned on me that 3D Studio is useless for my needs. I need	a mapping icon per applied texture.  I want to use a special purpose	graphics computer for rendering the 3DS models and it requires a texture	rule/plane to be specified in 3Space, i.e. position/orientation of the	mapping rule.  Since only one mapping icon is used in 3DS to apply	textures to ALL objects/faces, it renders (no pun intended) 3DS totally	unsuitable for my needs.		Anyone got a contact for Alias Upfront or any other good modeller for a	PC?  I must be able to specify texture rules (one per texture) and this	must be saved in a file which I can read.  I haven't found any info on Alias	in the copy of the faq that I have.		Rych

The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and	LightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional	photo-realistic images for a variety of purposes.		-- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --		This mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how	it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images	available to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and	LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the	package.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as	a group.		-- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --		Since LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster	software, I'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation	of the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving	specifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.		You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!		-- OK!

Just mail your articles to the	following address:		        lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com		Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all	others joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so	you know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those	addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back	to you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no	longer valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This	doesn't mean it hasn't been posted to the list.  In fact, just the	opposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it	couldn't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad	address.			-- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --		Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address	you used to sign up:		        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com		In the body of the message enter:		unsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain		I will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join	the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be	able to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the	list!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send	a request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend	forwarding of the articles to you.			-- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --		I am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the	originating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due	to lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a	compendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store	them in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an	index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that	relates.		If there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI	hard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>		I have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the	list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past	articles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to	the LightWave3D mailing list. For information on this service, please	send a mail message to:		        fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com		The first command to the server must be "HELP" or "USER name <passwd>".

Most JPEG viewers seem to require specific video drivers since they support	only specific video cards. Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for	the VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such as	the Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture	quality if your dithering works right).		I can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's to	GIF's before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards.	You don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGA	card and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+	computers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a	8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to write	some programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and other	colour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg	dithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette	the resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would	when viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but	it does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my way	gives a brighter more detailed image.		Anyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, as	far as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than the	VGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)		Have a day!

	My wife wants to publish a newsletter.

Right now she's	looking at Corel Draw and Harvard Draw. There seem to be more books in the	stores on Corel than on Harvard, so she's inclined to go with Corel on the	basis of popularity. Can anyone give us an informed opinion on which 	package would be more suitable or if there is an even better alternative	available? If this is a FAQ, please withhold the flames and just send the	location of the FAQ document. Thanks.

I'm	using Kochanek-Bartels splines (as described in the SIGGRAPH '84	proceedings) to create a variable number of inbetweens between	the key frames.  I want the inbetweens to be given in the form	(x,y,z,dx,dy,dz) where the last three argumentsa are the x, y and	z component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when	positioned at (x,y,z).		The method presented by Kochanek and Bartels only deals with the	positions of the inbetween view points to be generated.  I've	tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the	chord between the two adjacent view points (which in general are	not key frames), but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the	viewing direction vector at the key frame positions (although	the spatial movement seems to work fine; and I'm quite certain	- I think :) - that I've not simply made an implementation	error...)		Now I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for	similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors.	I'd appreciate replies to be emailed to me at	  iharkest@lise.unit.no	Anyone else interested in the answer will be sent a summary of	the replies if they contact me.		-- 	 _________     __________________	\\        \\  \\	 \\ N G E  \\==\\ A R K E S T A D     iharkest@lise.unit.no         Comp.

I was also	shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by	about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only	1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  What	is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due	mainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is	more like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at	different x/y values, the "ridges" are out of phase, resulting in the	stitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon	right on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see	a smeared effect where they overlap.	  Example:	  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)	      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)		Your implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when	rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces	with isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as	you say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the	system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the	application must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.	Bravo!

	I'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. What i want to do is	the following;		From a fast source, eg. a CDROM, several sound sources are read, each having	it's own defined position and other attributes, eg. direction etc.  Given the	listeners position and direction, the sum of sound played back in each of the	listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction.  This	means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's	incoming direction have to be done for each sound source.  (I think this is	possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles	relative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given	angle.  This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the	source.  This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source	changes position or the listener changes orientation.)  Additionally some	reflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined	could be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandation	simulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm.  		Have someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system? 		Please post or mail any answers or comments.		-- 	Torgeir Veimo		Studying at the University of Bergen		"...I'm gona wave my freak flag high!"

Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high 	refresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  	The card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local 	bus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).	        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers 	maximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate 	of 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 	non-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater 	than standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video 	standards.	        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa's FlickerFree(tm) technology, 	which eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more 	comfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility 	developed by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen 	and thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.	        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed 	offered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards 	will only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will 	transfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is 	also offering this card in the "TurboBahn" combination packaged 	with their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.	        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, 	WINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance 	value.  Genoa's advanced proprietary drivers act to "turbocharge" 	the chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with 	power and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced 	chip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and 	reliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D 	Studio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.  Driver updates and product bulletins 	are available on Genoa's BBS at (408) 943-1231.	        Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of 	graphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for 	IBM-compatible personal computers.  All products come with a two 	year limited warranty on parts and labor.  Genoa products are 	currently distributed worldwide through authorized distributors, 	resellers, VARs and systems integrators.

		Recently we have found TIFF manipulation packages which do not recognize	TIFF files output by xv.  This is due to a missing XRESOLUTION and YRESOLUTION	tag which apparently is required (or at least believed to be required) for	valid TIFF.

I have been told that I could find some code in tiff/tools/tiffcp.c, but	that directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv.

	I am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing	3-D interactive applications what types of 3-D widgets you would	like to have in your applications.  		A 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the 	application.  It may let you		- manipulate application data, the camera,	  3-D objects in the scene and so on, or	- view the status of the application or 3-D objects	  via the widget's shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or	- do whatever I missed but you think is possible.		For example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a	partially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated.	A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects.  The length	of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the	ruler indicating the distance.  A widget can provide both manipulation and	feedback.  For example, the ruler can be used to change the distance between	the objects along its own axis.			Please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3-D interaction.  The information	I gathered will help me design a 3-D UI construction tool.	Your help is very much appreciated.

			                FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE		          The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 21-24	          in Orlando, Florida.  The conference was organized by the Rensse-	          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-	          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-	          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was	          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS	          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-	          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and	          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS	          users  to  "take  charge of your PHIGS" by participating in PHIGS	          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS	          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,	          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  "beyond	          PHIGS".		          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following	          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,	          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented	          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS	          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and	          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed	          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The	          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-	          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools	          based on PHIGS.		          Next year's conference is planned for March, 1994.		          PHIGS EVERYWHERE		          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated	          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to	          mainframes.		          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including	          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing	          and translucency.		          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-	          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add	          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like	          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.	          Radiosity support is also planned.		          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging	          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate	          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase	          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.		          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful	          "2-call"  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-	          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.		          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on	          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-	          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company's  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-	          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS	          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS	          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data	          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS	          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described	          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions	          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G's data visual-	          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available	          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or	          Starbase.		          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows	          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most	          of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many	          advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-	          tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of  Z-PHIGS	          or ARENA is available on request.		          ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS  implemen-	          tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS.

		We need terrain data for a visualization research currently taking place	in Tel-Aviv university. We have two databases that we are currently working	on, but we would like to work on more databases, possibly more complicated 	and ones that will give prettier images.		Before I describe what kind of data we need, let me mention that we are 	going to present a paper titled "Photo-Realistic Imaging of Digital Terrains"	which describes the research and the results, in the EUROGRAPHICS'93 	conference in Barcelona, this september. We are going to show a video-tape 	with some of our results, so any good data that we will receive will be 	presented in the tape, with a mention of the donator.		We are working on databases consisting of aerial or satelite photographs, 	and terrain elevation maps (DTM). 	Each database consists of a 2D array of height values (any data format can	be used for each value), and a corresponding 2D array of color values (can	be gray-level, 256-color value or full 24-bit R/G/B values. Other format can	also be used). We work on 512X512 and 1024x1024 resolution databases.		If anybody has access to this kind of data, or knows where we can get such	data files, please respond in this news group, or - better - email us	directly :		amit@math.tau.ac.il    (Amit Shaked), or	danny@indigo.bgu.ac.il (Daniel Cohen)		Of course, the names of the people who will help us get the data will be	cited in our paper, and in further publications.

		More people have been asking for information on the Kubota graphics	workstations, so here is some more info on the Kenai/Denali vs. the	E&S Freedom.			Here is the text of a Denali vs. E&S Freedom done by D.H. Brown Associates.		------		Denali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics	subsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use	a parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both	have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of	pixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly	in performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have 	similar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market	penetration.		There remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and	E&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end	developer's dream system with plenty of performance potential and	flexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to	sixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at	a higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom	systems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that	support a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom	design treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing	developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose	applications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and	video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note	that KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not	require an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,	however, will remain much more flexible.		The KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.	Entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end	Freedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price	points.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because	it uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting	in better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide	strong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that	not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's	configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase	geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade	them separately as needed.		Both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at	workstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive	VGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide	this capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation	of textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher	qualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali	provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.	Aside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism	for texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics	data storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation	modules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels	to obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking	texturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable	solution.		Hope this helps,		Brian		PS This was reprinted without permission.

I guess I edited my note on this away from the article I posted to	many newsgroups.		I wrote something about making color modifications quickly	with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file	process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.	This makes sense, because the main use of XV is only viewing images.		Doing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications	in a buffer; and then before making the operations to 24bit image,	we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.			>And lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm.

I tried kept sure I don't claim that JPEG is noting else than	a compression algorithm, because I know what the JPEG is.	(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many	places so far.)		You also missed what is (were) wrong with XV. However, I did wrote it.			Juhana Kouhia

I have had	>a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results.	>Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help?	 	Certainly. Reference follows. 		Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called	red/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major	dysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long	wavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and	also means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.		The other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it	can also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.	It also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. 	Unlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.		On a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer	graphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour	deficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this	point. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red	corner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31		Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly	different values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental	setup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.		So if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?		This problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one	affected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto	which all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on	the spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is	very similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.		*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or	duuteranopia:		1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram	2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point	3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line	4) This is the new chromaticity. 		The best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour	defective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and	Applications 8(5) 28-40.		You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not	familiar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.		>I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow	>previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour	>blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!		Yes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red	green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and	the chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or	obtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a	couple of weeks ago.		The procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a	help here.)		A) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you	have the monitor data.	B) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'	using u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)	C) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above	D) find the intersection as in step 3	E) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A	F) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it	along a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and	white) until it is displayable.		>Please email replies - I will summarise and repost if there is	>sufficient interest		Done; also posted for the rest of us.		--	Chris Lilley	----------------------------------------------------------------------------	Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project	Computer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, 	Manchester, UK.

The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8	bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This	colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these	modifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped	to this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a	32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. 	Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?		Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to	each colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range	0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth	colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.		You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how	far each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look	rather odd.		So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:		>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How	>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global	>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and	>>much more complicated.		>>If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much	>>more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially.		In other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job.	Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.		As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV. If	that was not what you meant, then:		>(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many	>places so far.)		Yes, I probably did. I found that the collected digest format of your posting	made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was.

	Can anyone give me information or lead me to electronic information (not	books; I'm too poor...) regarding programming the standard graphics modes?	320x200x4 and 640x200x2 are easy enough, but I'm not so sure about the	rest.  Something about planes or something, and writing to ports and the	like, but I don't know the numbers or anything -- for the 16 color modes, I	think.  If I'm wrong, let me know.  Also, 320x200x256 is just one byte/pixel;	that's easy enough, but are there any other ways to write to the screen,	perhaps bytes at a time, or something like that?		Of course, I'd appreciate any information about any mode....  which reminds	me of another question -- do the SuperVGA modes work the same, generally,	as the normal 16 and 256 color modes, or is not only the mode numbers	for various cards different, but the methods for writing to the screen	different as well?		Thanks for any help you can give me...  I'm developing a screen class for	C++ and find myself searching for information.  Oh, I do have Ralf Brown's	Interrupt List, which has given me tons of invaluable information already.

Visualists from all technical levels		are welcome.  			REVOLT will be structured simply.  There will be 		three stages of production.  The first stage will		consist of all participants creating one still 		work as a "starter" piece that two other partici-		pants will, in turn, manipulate.  All first stage		"base" images are due by Sunday, May 23rd, 1993, 		midnight Central Daylight Time. 			Stage two will begin on May 24th.  All images will 		be sent to another (arbitrarily chosen) participant		for them to do manipulations on in anyway they see 		fit.  For purely digital artists, this may consist		of filtering the image through their favorite paint		program.  For "analog" artists, this may well be		printing a hardcopy of the image and adding their		own part with pen, pencil or white-out then scan-		ning in the image again to be transferred on to 		the third-stage artist.  All second-stage works		are due by midnight on Sunday, May 30th.			Stage three is the finishing stage and will begin		on May 31st.  All artists will do what they think 		it takes to finish up the image they've been given		using whatever technique they see as worthy.  		These images will be due on June 6th, midnight.			All involved will participate in each stage of		creation.			-----------------------------------------------------------		To join, send email/mail with the following info:			Name:		email address:		mail address:		scanner access?

Dear Prospective Employer:		I am seeking employment as a software engineer with interests in software	design and development, in which I can utilize my experience in hardware, 	C & C++ programming, graphical user interface (GUI), operating systems and	computer networking.		I received my Bachelors of Engineering (BE) degree in Electronics	Engineering in 1990 and a M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering in Dec 1992 	from Iowa State University. Currently I am enrolled in a M.S. in Computer	Engineering at Iowa State University.		During my Masters program, as a research assistant since Jan 1991, I have	published three papers including one in the IEEE Transactions on Magnetics.	These papers are a reflection of the quality of my research and my ability	to learn new concepts quickly.		I have been involved in many projects involving software developments and	have extensive experience programming in C, C++, Fortran and Assembly Level. 	I am also familiar with operating systems like Unix, Ultrix and MS-DOS.	I am familiar with Motif/X programming and currently, as a research assistant,	am involved in graphical user interface (GUI) design using the multiplatform 	GUI toolkit XVT++. My experiences also include areas such as operating systems	and computer networks, through course work and projects. I was involved in the	study of the design and development of the internals of the XINU operating	system. I have also been involved in many TCP/IP programming projects in	computer networking.		While in college I learnt the importance of clear and concise communication.	I have also learned a lot about time management. In my M.S. program I	have maintained a 3.70 grade average, worked 20 hours per week and	have enjoyed being involved in many other extra curricular activities.		My software experiences along with my hardware background (Electronics	Engineering) would be very helpful in my career goals as a software engineer.	I request that my qualifications may kindly be reviewed. I would like to	have an interview to discuss your employment needs and my career goals. 	I am eager to hear from you soon.			Sincerely		S.N.

We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit,	and my suggestion above works perfectly with it.		So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there	must be a colormap anyway. The problems you present are exist anyway,	and I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such	problems to my programs in the first place.		Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image	as I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image	back to 24 bit image.			>>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How	>>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global	>>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and	>>>much more complicated.		Ok, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit	and user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way,	jumps off the discussion a bit.		My solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit	image -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.			About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image:	changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most	cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may	make serious errors to anywhere in the image.	XV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the	mentioned type images.		Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global	changes. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like	paint program job.	If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the	original 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit	image, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to	modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if	image is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7	cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area --	selecting individual color is possible from that.		Ok, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen	such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention	24bit painting program in 8bit screen...			>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?		It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not	designed for that.	Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say,	person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is	expected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed	without thinking about human interface and how human expect the	program work -- design error.		I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but	it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making	major change to the original design.		So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved	images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.		Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where	'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes	up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,	even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.	(Americans: the lift is just an example :)			Well, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to	read it.			Juhana Kouhia	
	You can use PBM's 'rawtopgm' to convert three raw (r, g, b) files to pgm format. Then you can use pgm3toppm to convert the pgm files to a composite ppm file,	and feed this to cjpeg for compression. Slow, and circuitous, but it will	work.		Rick

	In article <9304271755.AA23355@enet-gw.pa.dec.com> you write:	>Anyone who thinks that TIFF is too complex hasn't dealt with	>CGM, ASN.1, CDA, DCA, SGML, or any one of a number of other	>very successful file format.  People seem perfectly capable	>dealing with these others.		Well, yeah, but unlike TIFF they all do substantially more than encode	rectangular bitmaps.  And the others are hardly trouble free.  I hear that	it is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate.		The annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 useful	options, there are 100 stupid options.  The most egregious example is that	rather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently	in all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on	all machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be prepared	to do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats --	again, any one of them would have been adequate.  RGB images can be stored	by pixel or by component, complexity without function, etc, etc.  I also	note that the TIFF doc says that Aldus' experiments show that LZW reliably	compresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats, suggesting that	none of the FAX formats are really useful.		What's worse, a lot of the formats aren't even implemented very well,	e.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would have	provided substantially better compression.  And the LZW method compresses	bytes rather than pixels.		But the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can register	proprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them.	This means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliably	read all incoming TIFF files.  Some standard.		Regards,	John Levine, johnl@iecc.cambridge.ma.us, {spdcc|ima|world}!iecc!johnl

What's sort of interesting about this whole thread is just how much	it has in common with similar threads in groups dealing with other vendor's	hardware.  I currently deal basically with hardware from 3 vendors - Apple,	DEC, and SGI - and thus tend to monitor the groups about those vendor's	hardware.  Currently, it seems like SGI customers are pissed at SGI about	dropping support for the Personal Iris, DEC customers are pissed at DEC for	dropping MIPS support in favor of the new Alpha boxes, and Apple customers	seem to get pissed every time a new Mac is introduced that's faster and	cheaper than the one they just bought.  When I used to be a Sun customer	years ago, I remember people being pissed at Sun for leaving their 386	and 680x0 customers out in the cold when Sparc came along.

	Please help.		I have an IBM-compatible notebook computer with an LCD VGA screen.  While I	was working with it this morning, the screen started to flicker a little,	which I thought was odd since I do use a surge-protector for my computer and	all peripherals.  It only did this for a second and then stopped.		I left the room for several minutes and, when I returned, the screen was	completely dim, not blank, but very very dim.  The contrast slider still	worked so that I could adjust it to where I could *faintly* make out what	was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely *no* effect.		I was plugged-in at the time (i.e., not using the battery) but I still	tried switching the battery, changing the power-saver features, etc., etc.,	all to no avail.		Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  If this just means that I	need to replace the screen then I guess I'll have to but I thought that the	"death" of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually	happened.  I didn't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the	net about this because I already know what they'll say: "Yep, you gotta have	this replaced and it's gonna cost you $???."		I've only had the computer for about 21 months.  Is that a reasonable life	cycle for a LCD display?  Oh, I guess I ought to give specifics here: the	brand is Compudyne (Is this a reputable company?), it's a 386SX @ 20 MHz.	I forget the model number exactly and I was too ticked off to write it down	before coming in to work today.		If anyone can help me, PLEASE give me any advice you might have.  I'm not	opposed to having it replaced, but I'd rather not if it's not absolutely	necessary.  If you wouldn't mind, please e-mail me at mike@mik.uky.edu	but if you'd rather post I'll be checking back here in a couple of days.		BTW, if the answer to this question is already in a FAQ somewhere, feel	free to flame away but I would ask that you also include the location and	name of the FAQ if you don't mind.

No, MIS folks have infinite budgets of death, and they also get parts	of their budget allocated "upgrades", "maintenance", and "new purchases",	and a lot of IBM mainframe purchases are actually "leases" and so	is the software.		Basically, the engineers who have tight budgets, i.e. the coders and	designers of a company, bitch and moan when they drop 15,000 on a 	Sparc 1 only to see a faster machine appear a year later.  MIS types	upgrade once every 5-10 years, and their costs are amortized and	depreciated over a longer period, and the budget office justifies	the expense because they actually use the machines for accounting,	payroll, etc.		Now, if the budget office was dependant on the engineers for some	reason like payroll and accounts, you'd sure as hell see every	engineer with a new Cray on his desktop every year. :-)		Brian

Look be consistent. First you post something that seems to suggest that you see	xv being an 8 bit program as some sort of error. 	So I post and asy it is not a bug, it is meant to be like that. 	So you post and say it is not a bug, you never said it was, I have misunderstood	etc.	Now you are saying:		>We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit,		If you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the	discussion a *lot* easier.		----------------		>So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there	>must be a colormap anyway.

No I don't think so actually. 		You were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising),	manipulating the colours in the colour editor, then somewhow applying these	changes to the 24 bit file when you exit xv. Xv lets you edit individual	colours. Where is this sudden jumping off the topic?		>My solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit	>image 		Yes I am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file!!		>-- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.

What are you saying	???		>XV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the	>mentioned type images.		Ah! now we see thew problem! First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8	bit previews of 24 bit images. Then I point out problems with this. Now you are	saying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use those	parts of the program that cause the problem!!			>Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global	>changes. 		Not sure what you are saying here. Certainly one can make local changes.		>In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like	>paint program job.	>If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the	>original 24bit image modified.

Yes that is one possible approach. I would find a program that took such an	approach clumsy, however.		>Ok, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen	>such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention	>24bit painting program in 8bit screen...		Well here we agree - you have not thought it through very much. You don't seem	to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the	next. OK, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one	through.		>>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?		>It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not	>designed for that.		As I said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It is a way of	saving disk space by trading off quality against compression. I fail to see what	the problem is. You have not proposed any workable alternatives.		>Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; 		Speak for yourself. You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who,	having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow	reverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made	to the 8 bit image palette.		Perhaps that is why you yused the singular?		>say,	>person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is	>expected that the image still is the same. 		Look, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main	control panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit	image. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit	file. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.		>So, XV were designed	>without thinking about human interface and how human expect the	>program work -- design error.		Is a design error the same as a bug? ;-)		Read my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets	you import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the	human interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it	was designed for. It makes no false claims.		>I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but	>it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making	>major change to the original design.		If you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of	precisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. So 	far, you have not done so.		>So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved	>images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.		Argh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily'. OK, go ahead and code it	if it is so easy.		Or alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'.		>Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where	>'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes	>up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,	>even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.	>(Americans: the lift is just an example :)		I think this is a bit of an exageration.		What you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in	the states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up. Everyone else	had no problem. Now you are trying to sue the manufacturer...		>Well, my text may be a bit hard reading, 		you bet		>hopefully you suggeeded to	>read it.		Mostly. Leaving aside the language issue however, it betrays some very wooly	thinking (as you yourself admit) which is the same in any language.

		   I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,	   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.	   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,	   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,	   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.		   The following is the relevant sections from the man page. 	   -----------------------------------------------------------------		Pre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)		NAME	   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations		DESCRIPTION	  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on	  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both	  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.		  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their	  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the	  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using	  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The	  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed	  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.		  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and	  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss	  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing	  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type	  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of	  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into	  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple	  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with	  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take	  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).		  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing	  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence	  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be	  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image	  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-	  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically	  giving great flexibility in processing an image.		FEATURES		  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a	  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, 	  the processed image will be displayed.		  Current features include		  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing	    and filling the "rotated out" region with an arbitrary color.		  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with	    the option of subpixel sampling.		  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an	    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving	    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to	    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text	    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as	    in TeX(1), e.g., $\alpha$\small$\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha	    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.		  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.		  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation	    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary	    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels	    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of	    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished	    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-	    lability of graphical histograms of the image.		  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-	    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at	    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some	    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering	    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,	    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions	    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a	    circle).		  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-	    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.		  o Performs histogram equalization.		  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of	    arbitrary order.		  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.		  o Cuts and pastes across images.		  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.		  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause	    interval between images.

Speaking of SIGGRAPH, I just went through the ordeal of my annual registration	for SIGGRAPH and re-upping of membership in the ACM last night, and was I ever	grossed out!  The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery!		For example:			SIGGRAPH basic fee went from $26 last year to $59 this year for the same		thing, a 127% increase.  Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the		annual conference could reduce this to $27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite,		which means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $32 (or so) for the		proceedings and the art show catalog, essentially.			TOPLAS went up 40% in cost, way outstripping the current inflation rate.			Basic SIGCHI fees remainded the same, but whereas before SIGCHI		membership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings,		these are now an extra cost option.  Bundling that back into the basic		rate, equivalent services have gone up 100% in cost.			SIGOIS membership cost has up 33%, but they've also split out the		Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to		be included with membership.  Adding that cost back in means this SIG		also has doubled its membership fee.		What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago	touting their new approach to providing member services, and tried to make it	sound like they were offering NEW services.  But with the exception of a couple,	like SIGGRAPH, all the "plus" services appear to be just splitting the costs	into smaller piles so that they don't look so big.  But their recommended	changes to my membership would have me paying 90% more than last year for a 31%	increase in services (measured by cost, not by value), and, curiously, a 31%	inflation rate on the publications I got last year.

		  A great many computer programmers read "Dr. Dobb's Journal".  In a recent	issue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read.  It	said:		  "There's nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer	industry.  The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90's."		  Where has the hacker ethic gone?  Not the "cracker" ethic, which is something	entirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the	free distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why is	it that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to	have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a person	like myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks,	crannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any	useful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely	ignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to	make truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves	hackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact	that the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so	for a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a	volume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller	than it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the	corporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the	286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.  		  That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of	innovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud	it; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative	systems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the	problem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for	blunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.		  I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists,	where?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves "hackers"	allowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative,	interesting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the	computer industry?

All	fields of science, engineering, medicine, and even business	applications now use AVS.  This seminar will focus on its many	features in technical detail during a half hour slide	presentation.  Following a question period there will be a live	demonstration using a Sun SPARCstation.  In addition, a new AVS	program called CAMPUS will be introduced at this meeting.		"Also discussed will be the International AVS Center, which	provides an on-line repository of over 1000 graphics modules at	the North Carolina Supercomputer Center in Raliegh, NC.

[ ..see previous article on this debate for the rests.. ]		I can see XV-3.00 agree with my view in cases you don't -- even I say	my personal opinion (as above), it doesn't mean that it is not most	obvious thing.	Please, if you use my previous writings as contradicting argument,	please do read them -- you have not saw them at all; you just	refered to text from which I wrote 'something' -- and you make	hard decisions from that, without reading what exactly I have written.		It is really hard read when one writes a reply line by line method	and don't understand include previously written material with the new	sentences to give them meaning. You seem to be one such.		You also start replying to my articles, even you don't understand what	is going on; you ask me repeatedly to decsribe my views what were	wrong with XV 2.21 even I posted them within the article you did reply	to. Believe me, it is not nice to get flamed specially when I know	that you have not read my article carefully in the first place.		XV-3.00 and JPEG FAQ and users I have written to agree me with the	places you didn't; I'm sure you just didn't undertand what about I	wrote. We can blame my writing skills (in English?) for that, or?		Better stop the discussion and check what new ideas XV-3.00 gives;	I allready mailed one to Bradley...			Juhana Kouhia

Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client	     itself.  Put the following on a gopher server:		       Type=1	       Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu	       Port=70	       Path=	       Name=Gopher Software Distribution.		 	     Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and	     look in the gopher directory.			     There are also a number of public telnet login sites available.	     The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine	     "consultant.micro.umn.edu" (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more	     information about this.  It is recommended that you run the client	     software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  A	     client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse,	     scroll bars, etc.)  A local client is also faster.		---------------------------------------------------------------------	Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to	     in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher?		A3:  Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize	     network lag.		     Telnet Public Logins:		     Hostname                  IP#              Login   Area	     ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------	     consultant.micro.umn.edu  134.84.132.4	gopher  North America	     gopher.uiuc.edu           128.174.33.160   gopher  North America	     panda.uiowa.edu           128.255.40.201	panda   North America	     gopher.sunet.se           192.36.125.2     gopher  Europe	     info.anu.edu.au           150.203.84.20    info    Australia	     gopher.chalmers.se        129.16.221.40    gopher  Sweden	     tolten.puc.cl             146.155.1.16     gopher  South America	     ecnet.ec		           157.100.45.2     gopher  Ecuador	     gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  Japan			     It is recommended that you run the client software instead of	     logging into the public login sites.  A client uses the	     custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)	     and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features	     of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file	     to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp	     sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.				---------------------------------------------------------------------	Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?		A4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University	     of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help	     our campus find answers to their computer questions.  		     It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information	     System used by a large number of sites in the world.		     Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to	     count. 		     The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached	     via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:	   	      Internet Gopher Developers	      100 Union St. SE #190	      Minneapolis, MN 55455  USA		     Or via FAX at:	 	      +1 (612) 625-6817		---------------------------------------------------------------------	Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?		A5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.	     As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to: 	     	       - Search local WAIS indices.	       - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher	         clients.	       - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher	         clients.	       - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using	         built in gopher querying or using native http querying.		-------------------------------------------------------------------	Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?		A6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :		     _The_Whole_Internet_, Ed Kroll, O'Reilly, 1992 (Editors note:	                             ..Great book, go out and buy a bunch!)		     _The_Internet_Passport: NorthWestNet's Guide to Our World Online"	     By Jonathan Kochmer and NorthWestNet.

A7: veronica:  Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to 	     Computerized Archives.		     veronica offers a keyword search of most gopher-server menu titles	     in the entire gopher web.  As archie is to ftp archives, veronica 	     is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher	     items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.	     Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy	     to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the	     gopher protocol.		     To try veronica, select it from the "Other Gophers" menu on 	     Minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at:		     Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace) 	     Type=1 	     Port=70 	     Path=1/veronica 	     Host=futique.scs.unr.edu		------------------------------------------------------------------------------		Q8: What is Available for Biology?		A8: There is an incredible amount of software, data and information	    availble to biologists now by gopher.

Since this was posted on comp.ai, I assume there is an AI angle to this.  Hacking is	what AI students do when they're really supposed to be doing something else, e.g.	thesis research & write up, getting their supervisors' pet programs to run properly,	etc.  No-one gets much glory for hacking, and no-one gets any money out of it.	Producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources that	not many people can, or want to, afford - particularly during a recession.		In addition, over the last 10 years, I think there has been a de-emphasis on producing	running programs in AI research, and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to	problem-solving.  Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs.	At a conference a year or two ago, Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should	'Get back to the keyboard' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas -	and I have to say I'm inclined to agree.		(I don't claim to be a superhacker, but I don't think that invalidates my remarks.	And I'm sure this isn't the whole story.)			--	Peter Jackson, Dept of Electrical & Computer Eng, Clarkson University	"Opinions expressed are not those of my employer or any other organization"	Second Violin, Fiddling Firefighters Ensemble (Rome Branch)

Don't look for radicalism among us	>old ones; we're gone...		Perhaps all of us hackers have become (ICK) PROFESSIONALS?  I have noticed	my and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals.	It is rather distasteful.  It occurs when a series of things happen:		   1) one's ego outgrows one's talent/knowledge	   2) one's financial situation takes precedence	   3) A change in priorities (esp. family) possibly leading to 2)	   4) the hacker's attitude makes the shift from "fun" to "work"	   5) one's vocation burns away the creativity needed for "the hobby"		or the biggest killer (IMO)		   6) one's dreams are (sadly) shattered on the hard rocks of society's	      version of reality.  Without the dream the motivation dies, without	      the motivation the effort seems useless.		Another set of problems stems from our children.  While most of us remember	when there were several completely different computer systems, our children	are growing up with just a few choices (MSDOS/Mac/Amiga) and do not enjoy	the diversity we did.  I remember the great computer fallout of the early	eighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systems	that were now dead.  The diversity of systems before then allowed for widely	divergent paradigms.  That period forced hackers to continually learn new	systems in the attempt to keep up.  Not to mention that if a program was	needed we were forced (in most situations) to write it ourselves as a	commercial offering was just not available.  Now our children are being	taught the "user" mentality.  As the number of us "old-timers" dwindle we are	not being replaced by the next generation.

It is not a picture file format, sound	file format, but there exist several formats that use the IFF standard.  The	IFF picture standard used by mostly everybody is a FORM ILBM (or just ILBM).	The only 3D IFF specification I know of is TDDD, which is used by Imagine and	it's predecessor, Turbo Silver.   It is possible that some of the other Amiga	packages use another *IFF* spec, but I don't know of any.  Lightwave will load	TDDD FORM's I believe.		--	Christopher B.

JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized image compression mechanism.	JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the	committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either	full-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes.	It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line	drawings.		JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it	handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types	of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG	respectively.		JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't	quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much	of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably	the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details	of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will	be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the	small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are	invisible to the eye.		A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by	adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade	off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small	files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image	archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you	aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you	can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.			[2]  Why use JPEG?		There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store	24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.		Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across	networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a	2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in	disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the	size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)		If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to	convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even	with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image	than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using	JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to	store or transmit an image more cheaply.		It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the	time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the	extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.		The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet	posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel	(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have	only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage	to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as	black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed	in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among	people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably	more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.			[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?		JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,	GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first	things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.		As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or	gray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs and	similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display	hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)		GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,	such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels	that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed	by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without	introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.	(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they	should be avoided in JPEG files.)		JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels	adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to	come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this	sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly	often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is	particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.	If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.		Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between	scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and	subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.	The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).		Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.	You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale	images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images	of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.		If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you	should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.	(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only	applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from	a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG	can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify	converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.	If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be	prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not	convert well.			[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?		Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have	handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three	files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG	software described in section 6B.		File	   Size in bytes		Comments		ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits				 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)	ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress				 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.				 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.	ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif				 Most of the savings is the result of losing color				 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)		ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)				 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,				 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.	ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)				 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this				 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.	ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50				 This has slight defects; if you know what to look				 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing				 the original.  Still as good image quality as many				 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.	ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25				 JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent				 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).				 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were				 of poorer image quality than this.	ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)				 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or				 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:				 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !		In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller	than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the	GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical	ratio for real-world scenes.			[5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?		Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by	selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about	the meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of the	information", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;	it's not a percentage of anything.		The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting	(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from	the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one	observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.		The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This	setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a	typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for	experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a	file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.		If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to	go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you	might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.	The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.	The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to	95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).		If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are	prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is	about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".		(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG	software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other	JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different	quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just	"high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)			[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?		Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.	If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources".	(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the	same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can	get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with	"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body.  The "Anonymous FTP	List FAQ" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in	the news.answers archive.		months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.			[6A]  If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc:		The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one	kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out	the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this	list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over	Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.		X Windows:		XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other	image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image	manipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),	file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support	for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new	and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding	edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that	version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get	only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works	fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a	glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkbox	when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.		Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,	also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.	This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The	ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped	displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the	basic free JPEG software.		Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple	image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest	release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,	file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,	said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.	(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current	xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4	decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next	xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from	export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said	to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.			MS-DOS:		This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.		One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.	The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca	(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic	viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is	not flashy, but it's functional.		Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The	current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE	below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU	and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and	OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no	bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit	on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).	You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it	slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a	bit tricky; read the directions carefully!		A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to	install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is	also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---	more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a	little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than	screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both	are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from	Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.	Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip	or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in	VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains	that the driver is missing.)		A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around	the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.	The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.	The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly	and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.		The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest	revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:	it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is	poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a	good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and	mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.		Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these	viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*	of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs	to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you	have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to	find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right	thing with hi-color displays.)		The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20	and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or	jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS	compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will	convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.		Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.	These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in	particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major	advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary	JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format	files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version	2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from	Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.	not readable on non-PC platforms.		Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation	package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI	formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.	A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and	mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.		NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs	is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20	runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document	refers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means	"pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should	expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several	Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;	most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA	mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files	in (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you can	retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in	comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,	consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.		Microsoft Windows:		There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.	(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,	due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion	programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)		The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0	is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.	Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills	viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it	decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.	But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...		JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the	decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG	files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful	features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's	an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from	ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.	(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,	including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)		WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;	it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.	It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and	slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror	sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow	286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,	which is roughly 25% faster.)		ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising	contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it	has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the	current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file	pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will	be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)		DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen	mode, not in a window.		OS/2:		The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).	is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.	/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip	    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.	/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip	    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.	/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip	    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.	    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.	/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip	    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows	    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.	/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip	    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing	    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed	    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.		Macintosh:		Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of	the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.	To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running	System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install	the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get	QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.	(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0	in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and	considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,	some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)		Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is	not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for	details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.	Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.		The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images	that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can	convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big	improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu	(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and	QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color	image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can	view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's	the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a	typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down	to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other	viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people	like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very	well thought out.		GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and	PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest	version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file	/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.	GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but	it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion	capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of	playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can	load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if	your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)	converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.		JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is	available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.	This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.	You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.		Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF	converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this	program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.		Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and	GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie	from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.	Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's	really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.	Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces	relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,	and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an	unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not	intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called	PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash	it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much	cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that	Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)		Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.	This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but	it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on	older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't	use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file	/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a	downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.		If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),	GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you	don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.		More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not	all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version	2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG	plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded	JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.		Amiga:		(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at	amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this	archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good	choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)		HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a	general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read	several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version	is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file	amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger	than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.		Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,	and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even	capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The	current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror	sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is	supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under	AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)		Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,	available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file	amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.		If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages	that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24	and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and	ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,	effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are	distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),	from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation	software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another	well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.		The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from	amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file	AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.		The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many	based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks	to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without	so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG",	"VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,	anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space	it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.		Atari ST:		The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,	from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.	These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.		For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level	grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available	from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.		I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for	Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.		Acorn Archimedes:		!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view	JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,	although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.		Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle	JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be	found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by	registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,	The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).		There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write	functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image	format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not	necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,	Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.			Portable software for almost any system:		If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free	JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.	If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a	display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa	or PPM 24-bit image files.		There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every	day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find	the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,	purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether	the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can	handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are	not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.			[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:		Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent	JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,	documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.	The "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9	or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release	is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to	retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.	If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may	prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE	above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on	CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.	If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest	comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.	(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ	article "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.)		The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and image	files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.	The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other	programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have	tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.		We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.	Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.	We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in	product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).	We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with	anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.		The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to	contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.			[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?		Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.	Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display	256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the	computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative	colors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is something	of a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  We're stuck with	the standard usage though.)		Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most	images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact	on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at	the very lowest JPEG quality settings).		Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display	on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for	*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what	comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.	This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little	differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably	come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared"	into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to	display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image	source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.		(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about	the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count	the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you	different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see	posted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster	(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.	JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but	number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)		On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to	256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its	palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)	For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the	sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.	This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's	quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than	what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer	image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.	Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization	algorithm, you're out of luck.		For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality	for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.	JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display	hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future	improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in	this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG	images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was	sent.		It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather	shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA	display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you	need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color	quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's	also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use	high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in	normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be	displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average	GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!		Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display	hardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on	workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already	obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their	display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.	Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images	in a machine-independent fashion.			[8]  How does JPEG work?		The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine	transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy	coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more	than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.	This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files	/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in	using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.			[9]  What about lossless JPEG?		There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did	define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the	final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this	lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG	algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few	implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.		Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.	What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient	quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the	color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say	"-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial	JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)		Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG	algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in	various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel	value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,	but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.		At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps	half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG	provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees	bit-for-bit accuracy.		If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less	than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the	JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG	lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with	6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a	Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.			[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?		Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;	it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was	prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international	standards organizations.		Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on	a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of	official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to	"do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with	anybody else's.		The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work	that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined	two JPEG-based file formats:	  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports	    pixels and not much else.	  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is	    a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you	    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is	    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,	    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different	    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the	    mix will do anything to improve this situation.	Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors	of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial	products will adhere to one or both standards.		I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in	picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the	TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still	unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well	defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest common	denominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.		A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime	software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped	inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and	QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are	available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor	that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF	by hand; see section 11 for details.		Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and	Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF	format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by	HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be	used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This	applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF	format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format	files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)			[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?		If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely	to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell	what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:		1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,	    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.		2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a	    "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---	    it's worth a try, anyway.		3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI	    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they	    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.		4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred	    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off	    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.		5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are	    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.	    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),	    try stripping off everything before that.		In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is			"begin" line		M_]C_X ...		whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with			"begin" line		M:'-I ...		If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of	downloading non-JFIF files.			[12]  What about arithmetic coding?		The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final output	of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.	The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually	produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding	produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the	file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)		Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the	JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.	Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses	from these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implement	and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious	at best.)		At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about	arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the	potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*	be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.		There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the	future.  Stay tuned for further details.			[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?		It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could	decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it	without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.	Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered	image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the	first time around.		The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress	it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an	identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current	free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff	error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually	degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation	output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)	One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can	be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.		In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that	compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original	quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes	as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.	(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.	If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but	that's a mighty limited capability!)		The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and	transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate	format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format	(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are	ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot	of compression/decompression time this way :-).			[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?		As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you	convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original	full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from	that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,	here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum	loss of quality.		The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to	make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;	that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality	setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in	section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors	don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality	will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)		Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best	candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer	the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.	Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't	expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created	directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have	to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through	JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,	not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).		Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color	border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of	storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp	border boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourself	a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows	system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless	way to do this.)		cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but	for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid	image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher	Q setting may not be necessary.)		Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to fool	your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.	If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of	significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels	together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The	trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency	color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG	file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have	gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).	To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression.	Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that	you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid	color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will	often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of	the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image	than you'd get without smoothing.		With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing	capability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs.	Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed	dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular	fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong	smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur	the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing	wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as	pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is	a LOT faster than pnmconvol...		The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably a	good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the	image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.			---------------------		For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in	particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.		-- 				tom lane				organizer, Independent JPEG Group

		Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's 		Contest Announcement)		WHAT IS ACCESS.bus?		ACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer 	peripheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that 	uses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to 	a single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or 	keypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR 	gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and 	others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications 	such as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, 	Multiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more 	can now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts 	Plug and Play on every PC.		The ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of 	systems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host 	computer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a 	number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software 	development.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-	platform use of the same device.		ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:	=====================================		ACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone 	to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without 	fee or royalty.	ACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single 	host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus 	data rate is 100 Kbits/sec.		ACCESS.bus Physical Layer	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^	ACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware 	protocol, with one data line and one clock line.	Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level 	handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock 	synchronization.  		ACCESS.bus Software Protocols	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^	The ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three 		I2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines 	arbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C 	provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with 	different clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, 	framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the 	receiver.  		BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between 	a host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the 	ACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an 	ACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with 	additional semantics, including checksum.	Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot 	plugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus 	addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot 	plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the 	system is running, without rebooting.		APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus 	protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular 	types of devices.  Each type requires a different Application 	Protocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: 	keyboards, locators, and text devices.		ACCESS.bus support on the PC	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^	All three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the 	PC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the 	base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  	An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 	- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with 	the ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for 	multiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and 	Windows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples 	of the interface from applications to the device drivers.

	This is an invitation to send articles to the Informatica magazine.	The first fully international issue has been published and echoes 	are quite favourable. For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si). 		Dear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993		Number 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you 	will receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured	in the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page	-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited	part of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for	knowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);	and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to	give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the	journal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views	into the discourse.	   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page	expresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems	within the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other	concerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,	mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology 	(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this	page for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get	suggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express	their strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the	area in question.	   On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published.	The aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional 	achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on	one side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which	editors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should	be instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the 	understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.	   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have	a stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular	number can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation	right now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your	colleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the	contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.	A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh	ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.	   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)	and particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.	You can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.	On the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual	reports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing	in Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.	   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.	You can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete	papers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received	several final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,	Russia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed	texts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact	person (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So,	you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning	our common interest and job.		At the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in	every mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various	possibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and 	philosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,	and on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to give	proposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail	and by other means.		Sincerely yours,		Anton P. "Zeleznikar	Editor-in-chief

		I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that	will do compositing of a series of pictures?

		  In an attempt to do animation with POV I have created two little	programs. One is a C program that will perform a "morph" between	any two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And then	it will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out	to a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions	and insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this would	let me do simple animation. However, I have discovered that simply	performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary	object but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I know	an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the	origin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there 	must be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was because	I had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new	point and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. However	this occurs on objects that are not translated at all. Any help is 	appreciated.		ttknock@bbs.santafe.edu

I get regular questions about gamma correction since I go to great pains to	deal with it properly in xli (the image loader program I maintain).		Here is an explanation I often use to answer these questions.		This might be suitable for inclusion in the FAQ.			Graeme Gill.		###########################################################################	"A note on gamma correction and images"		        graeme@labtam.oz.au				"What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?"	--------------------------------------		Although it would be nice to think that "an image is an image",	there are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of	different image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole	lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit	complicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you've ever downloaded	images from BBS or the net, you've probably noticed (with most image	viewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some	look too light. "Why is this ?" you may ask. This, is gamma correction	(or the lack of it).		Why do we need gamma correction at all ?	--------------------------------------		Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode	ray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you	have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer	image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of	the scene, then you have created a "linear" or un-gamma-corrected	image. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate	the image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding	and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).	Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage	and feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn't_ give you	an amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light	coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage	something like this:		Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma		So if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image	will look much too dark. To fix this up you have to "gamma correct"	the image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT	will do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get	what you want. So you have to do this to your image:		gamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)		For most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.		If that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?	-----------------------------------------------------		The problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.	Also not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras	or video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images	already have some gamma correction done to them, and you are 	rarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images	with a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets	corrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those	images with a program that doesn't do gamma correction, then it will	look vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is	not exactly right for you particular CRT.		Whose fault is all this ?	-----------------------		It is really three things. One is all those display programs	out there that don't do gamma correction properly. Another is	that most image formats don't specify a standard gamma, or	don't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.	The third thing is that not many people understand what gamma	correction is all about, and create a lot of images with varying	gamma's.		At least two file formats do the right thing.	The Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording	the gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)	specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a	linear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).		Some image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)	allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you	are using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to	view. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and	utilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma	of an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction	yourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,	and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.		[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn't provide an easy way of modifying the	gamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the	appropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity	in the HSV controls doesn't do the right thing, as it fails to	take account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends	to give a tint to the image. ]		How can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?	---------------------------------------------------------------------		The simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg	(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file	containing two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear	to the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using	dithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects	images, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point	at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half	way from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if	you move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a	bit.)		If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have	a long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness	will be above the center.		If your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction	for a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the	gamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be	around 2.2 		[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the	-dispgamma flag, and once you've got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA	environment variable in your .profile]		How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?	-------------------------------------------------		This is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of	true color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of	1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma	correction. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images	(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected	to some degree or other.		If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will	look good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.		If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then linear images will	look too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.		Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing	-----------------------------------------------------		One of the reason that many high quality formats (such as	Video) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better	use of the storage medium. This is because the human	eye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction	has a similar compression characteristic. This means images 	could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),	if they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that	every time you want to do any image processing you should	convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain	the same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and	none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard	gamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected	images at the popular level.		If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,	and if image manipulation software takes care to use	extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,	then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.		(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a	standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the	highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).		###########################################################################

JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized image compression mechanism.	JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the	committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either	full-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes.	It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line	drawings.		JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it	handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types	of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG	respectively.		JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't	quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much	of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably	the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details	of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will	be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the	small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are	invisible to the eye.		A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by	adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade	off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small	files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image	archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you	aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you	can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.			[2]  Why use JPEG?		There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store	24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.		Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across	networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a	2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in	disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the	size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)		If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to	convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even	with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image	than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using	JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to	store or transmit an image more cheaply.		It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the	time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the	extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.		The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet	posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel	(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have	only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage	to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as	black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed	in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among	people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably	more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.			[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?		JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,	GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first	things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.		As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or	gray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs and	similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display	hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)		GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,	such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels	that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed	by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without	introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.	(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they	should be avoided in JPEG files.)		JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels	adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to	come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this	sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly	often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is	particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.	If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.		Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between	scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and	subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.	The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).		Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.	You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale	images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images	of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.		If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you	should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.	(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only	applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from	a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG	can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify	converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.	If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be	prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not	convert well.			[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?		Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have	handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three	files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG	software described in section 6B.		File	   Size in bytes		Comments		ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits				 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)	ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress				 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.				 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.	ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif				 Most of the savings is the result of losing color				 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)		ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)				 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,				 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.	ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)				 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this				 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.	ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50				 This has slight defects; if you know what to look				 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing				 the original.  Still as good image quality as many				 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.	ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25				 JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent				 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).				 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were				 of poorer image quality than this.	ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)				 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or				 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:				 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !		In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller	than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the	GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical	ratio for real-world scenes.			[5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?		Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by	selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about	the meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of the	information", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;	it's not a percentage of anything.		The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting	(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from	the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one	observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.		The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This	setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a	typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for	experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a	file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.		If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to	go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you	might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.	The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.	The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to	95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).		If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are	prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is	about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".		(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG	software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other	JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different	quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just	"high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)			[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?		Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.	If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources".	(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the	same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can	get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with	"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body.  The "Anonymous FTP	List FAQ" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in	the news.answers archive.		months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.			[6A]  If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc:		The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one	kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out	the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this	list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over	Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.		X Windows:		XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other	image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image	manipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),	file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support	for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new	and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding	edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that	version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get	only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works	fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a	glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkbox	when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.		Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,	also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.	This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The	ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped	displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the	basic free JPEG software.		Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple	image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest	release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,	file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,	said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.	(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current	xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4	decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next	xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from	export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said	to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.			MS-DOS:		This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.		One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.	The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca	(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic	viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is	not flashy, but it's functional.		Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The	current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE	below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU	and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and	OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no	bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit	on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).	You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it	slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a	bit tricky; read the directions carefully!		A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to	install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is	also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---	more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a	little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than	screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both	are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from	Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.	Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip	or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in	VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains	that the driver is missing.)		A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around	the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.	The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.	The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly	and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.		The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest	revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:	it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is	poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a	good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and	mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.		Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these	viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*	of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs	to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you	have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to	find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right	thing with hi-color displays.)		The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20	and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or	jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS	compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will	convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.		Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.	These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in	particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major	advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary	JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format	files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version	2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from	Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.	not readable on non-PC platforms.		Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation	package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI	formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.	A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and	mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.		NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs	is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20	runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document	refers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means	"pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should	expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several	Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;	most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA	mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files	in (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you can	retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in	comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,	consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.		Microsoft Windows:		There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.	(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,	due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion	programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)		The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0	is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.	Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills	viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it	decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.	But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...		JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the	decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG	files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful	features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's	an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from	ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.	(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,	including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)		WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;	it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.	It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and	slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror	sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow	286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,	which is roughly 25% faster.)		ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising	contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it	has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the	current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file	pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will	be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)		DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen	mode, not in a window.		OS/2:		The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).	is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.	/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip	    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.	/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip	    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.	/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip	    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.	    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.	/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip	    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows	    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.	/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip	    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,	    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has	    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.		Macintosh:		Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of	the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.	To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running	System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install	the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get	QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.	(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0	in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and	considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,	some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)		Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is	not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for	details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.	Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.		The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images	that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can	convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big	improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu	(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and	QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color	image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can	view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's	the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a	typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down	to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other	viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people	like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very	well thought out.		GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and	PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest	version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file	/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.	GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but	it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion	capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of	playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can	load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if	your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)	converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.		JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is	available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.	This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.	You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.		Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF	converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this	program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.		Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and	GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie	from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.	Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's	really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.	Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces	relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,	and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an	unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not	intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called	PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash	it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much	cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that	Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)		Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.	This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but	it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on	older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't	use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file	/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a	downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.		If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),	GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you	don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.		More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not	all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version	2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG	plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded	JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.		Amiga:		(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at	amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this	archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good	choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)		HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a	general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read	several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version	is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file	amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger	than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.		Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,	and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even	capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The	current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror	sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is	supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under	AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)		Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,	available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file	amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.		If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages	that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24	and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and	ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,	effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are	distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),	from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation	software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another	well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.		The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from	amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file	AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.		The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many	based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks	to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without	so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG",	"VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,	anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space	it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.		Atari ST:		The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,	from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.	These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.		For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level	grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available	from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.		I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for	Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.		Acorn Archimedes:		!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view	JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,	although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.		Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle	JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be	found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by	registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,	The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).		There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write	functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image	format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not	necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,	Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.		NeXT:		ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format	conversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.	ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at	sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are	currently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specific	sub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that	does not support JPEG.			Portable software for almost any system:		If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free	JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.	If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a	display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa	or PPM 24-bit image files.		There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every	day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find	the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,	purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether	the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can	handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are	not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.			[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:		Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent	JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,	documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.	The "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9	or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release	is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to	retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.	If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may	prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE	above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on	CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.	If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest	comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.	(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ	article "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.)		The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and image	files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.	The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other	programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have	tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.		We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.	Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.	We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in	product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).	We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with	anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.		The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to	contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.			[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?		Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.	Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display	256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the	computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative	colors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is something	of a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  We're stuck with	the standard usage though.)		Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most	images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact	on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at	the very lowest JPEG quality settings).		Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display	on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for	*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what	comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.	This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little	differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably	come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared"	into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to	display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image	source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.		(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about	the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count	the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you	different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see	posted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster	(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.	JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but	number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)		On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to	256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its	palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)	For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the	sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.	This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's	quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than	what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer	image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.	Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization	algorithm, you're out of luck.		For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality	for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.	JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display	hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future	improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in	this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG	images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was	sent.		It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather	shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA	display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you	need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color	quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's	also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use	high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in	normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be	displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average	GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!		Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display	hardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on	workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already	obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their	display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.	Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images	in a machine-independent fashion.			[8]  How does JPEG work?		The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine	transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy	coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more	than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.	This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files	/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in	using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.			[9]  What about lossless JPEG?		There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did	define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the	final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this	lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG	algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few	implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.		Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.	What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient	quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the	color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say	"-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial	JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)		Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG	algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in	various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel	value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,	but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.		At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps	half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG	provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees	bit-for-bit accuracy.		If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less	than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the	JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG	lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with	6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a	Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.			[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?		Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;	it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was	prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international	standards organizations.		Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on	a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of	official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to	"do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with	anybody else's.		The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work	that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined	two JPEG-based file formats:	  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports	    pixels and not much else.	  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is	    a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you	    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is	    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,	    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different	    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the	    mix will do anything to improve this situation.	Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors	of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial	products will adhere to one or both standards.		I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in	picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the	TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still	unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well	defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest common	denominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.		A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime	software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped	inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and	QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are	available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor	that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF	by hand; see section 11 for details.		Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and	Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF	format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by	HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be	used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This	applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF	format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format	files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)			[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?		If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely	to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell	what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:		1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,	    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.		2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a	    "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---	    it's worth a try, anyway.		3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI	    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they	    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.		4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred	    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off	    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.		5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are	    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.	    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),	    try stripping off everything before that.		In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is			"begin" line		M_]C_X ...		whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with			"begin" line		M:'-I ...		If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of	downloading non-JFIF files.			[12]  What about arithmetic coding?		The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final output	of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.	The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually	produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding	produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the	file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)		Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the	JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.	Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses	from these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implement	and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious	at best.)		At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about	arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the	potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*	be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.		There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the	future.  Stay tuned for further details.			[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?		It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could	decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it	without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.	Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered	image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the	first time around.		The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress	it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an	identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current	free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff	error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually	degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation	output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)	One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can	be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.		In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that	compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original	quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes	as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.	(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.	If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but	that's a mighty limited capability!)		The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and	transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate	format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format	(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are	ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot	of compression/decompression time this way :-).			[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?		As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you	convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original	full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from	that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,	here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum	loss of quality.		The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to	make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;	that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality	setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in	section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors	don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality	will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)		Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best	candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer	the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.	Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't	expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created	directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have	to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through	JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,	not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).		Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color	border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of	storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp	border boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourself	a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows	system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless	way to do this.)		cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but	for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid	image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher	Q setting may not be necessary.)		Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to fool	your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.	If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of	significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels	together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The	trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency	color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG	file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have	gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).	To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression.	Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that	you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid	color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will	often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of	the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image	than you'd get without smoothing.		With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing	capability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs.	Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed	dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular	fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong	smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur	the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing	wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as	pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is	a LOT faster than pnmconvol...		The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably a	good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the	image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.			---------------------		For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in	particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.		-- 				tom lane				organizer, Independent JPEG Group

Yes.  Here's what you should do.		Keep the vertices in an array, and have the polygons (triangles are okay,	but n-sided polygons are slightly more efficient) store the indices into	the array of the vertices that comprise them.  You set a flag for each	vertex when you transform it, so you don't have to transform any vertex	more than once; you also do backface elimination before processing the	polygon, so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys don't have	to be transformed at all.		Whenever you transform a vertex, check if it's on the far side of the hither	plane; if it is, you can project it right away and store the result.		Then do your Z clip; any vertices that get produced will have to have their	projection done at that stage.		-- 		Bernie Roehl	        University of Waterloo Dept of Electrical and Computer Engineering		Mail: broehl@sunee.UWaterloo.ca		Voice:  (519) 885-1211 x 2607 [work]

(7) Detail:		   Initialization:	      Set default display type to highest display type.	      Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).		   1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this	      menu you can press any function key. If you move or copy	      files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like	      'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.	      The header line in 'read' menu includes "(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)".	        d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.	      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use	        for reading current file.	      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This	        program will automatically determine which format this file is.	        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check	        standard extension. Still fail, report error.	      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.	        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key	          (except ESCAPE).	        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.	+       'w' or 'W' to pause, any key to continue.	        ESCAPE to terminate.	      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.	      pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.	+     pressing F5 will turn on 'effect' menu.		   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.	      You can do special effect on image.	      pressing RETURN: show image.	        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text	        mode.	      pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do	        special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.	      pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.	      pressing SPACE: save current image to file.	        B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).	        Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).	        Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).	        True Color: save as 24-bit image.		        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image	        to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program	        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another	        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after	        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change	        directory to what you want. Then,		        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.	        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename	                      (filename under bar).			  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.		  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,	     the performance is poor.		  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :	       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...		     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):	       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster	       (No one is better for true 24bits image)		  6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.		  7. Not all subroutines are fully tested		  8. This document is not well written.

Another	way to do it is to render the scene without the glass object and save the	image.  Then assign that image to your glass object as a reflection.  It will	take a lot of adjusting for position and size of the reflection, but that's	the only thing I can think of.

	Hi I'm new to imaging, and my advisor and I would like to 	do some 3D reconstructions.		We take slides (biological), and image them on a 486.  Then	the software allows us to trace the outline of the objects 	we want to save.  The outlines are stored as a TIFF file.		We would like to convert a group of these outlines into a 	3D image.  We are unsure as to where to begin.  Someone mentioned	that if we could convert the TIFF into a vector format then 	we could view them in Autocad.		Any help would be greatly appreciated.		Pankaj Oberoi	spedhead@athena.mit.edu		
	I recently read in a book that the TIFF version 6.0 specification was due	to be released in the spring of 1992.  I am interested in finding out about	the new features of the TIFF spec (and if it is out).  Specifically, I need	to know if TIFF 6.0 supports VQ decompression and/or image	tiling.	
	Hello,			Does anyone know of an image format conversion tool that will convert a 	raw (8 bit grey scale) image to Gif or Tif format.  It would be great if the tool	ran on a PC, was a Windows application, and supported other formats, but I'll be 	happy with anything that works.

Thanks.	> 		The GL file is an archive containing individual frames or pieces of	frames (usually stored as .PIC or .CLP files), fonts, and a .TXT file	that tells the GRASP animation system how to display it.  GL stands	for Grasp Library.  There is probably a detailed discussion of this subject	in the alt.binaries.pictures FAQ.		There are freely distributable viewers for GL files, and they are usually	named GRASPRT?.EXE (replace the ? with a version digit or letter).  Most	GL files contain frames that are hardware-specific to particular modes	of the CGA, EGA, or VGA adapters on PCs.  I think that there are some	copies of GRASPRT available by anonymous ftp (I know that I got one there	a long time ago).

	       I'm looking for code that will generate a minimum-volume oriented	bounding box for an arbitrary polyhedron.  Anyone know of such code?		       Why?  I'm converting objects from	one modelling system into another, and the destination system is object	oriented.

		Hello,		We are looking for a graphics package (preferably complete	with source code) that will run on our UNIX operating system	(a Sequent running DYNIX 3.2).  This graphics package must 	support a wide variety of character based graphics devices 	(PC's running a terminal emulator, primarily).  	At this point, X11 graphics is not an option.		This graphics program should, if possible, support these	sorts of graphics operations (minimum requirements):		   1) Complicated axes (log, linear, etc.) with fairly	      precise axis labels (multi-line labels, etc.)	      Major and minor tickmarks on axes, etc.		  	   2) It would be nice if some limited amount of color	      plotting were available, if the output device	      supported it.		We have a copy of gnuplot and are currently using it, but	gnuplot has some limitations.  We are looking for something	more robust than gnuplot.		At this point, I'm looking for information about packages that	might solve our problems.  If you have any information, please	contact me at the above email address.  If the product you know	about is a commercial software package, please send a phone number	or email address so that I can contact them about pricing, etc.		Annette Koontz	Battelle Pacific Northwest	Richland, WA 99352 USA

Also, my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB,	even using 24 bits/pixel (which is more bits than you actually need - 15 or	18 should be enough for a moving picture).  1600x1100x16bits is 3.5MB (I'm	guessing at HDTV resolution - it may be a bit wider than 1600, I'm fairly	sure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals).			I hope you have a very fast memory system as well - 180MB/s while	displaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system.			Unless you have a _very_ compelling reason, I'd advise trying to use	at least somewhat compressed data.  You don't have to go to full compression	to get to a level where the data IO requirements are much cheaper and easier	to deal with.		-- 	GNU Emacs is a LISP operating system disguised as a word processor.	 - Doug Mohney, in comp.arch		Randell Jesup, Jack-of-quite-a-few-trades, Commodore Engineering.	jesup@cbmvax.commodore.com or rutgers!cbmvax!jesup	BIX: rjesup  	
		Hello		I have posted to this newsgroup once before and recieved a	moderately helpful response on a couple of issues. This I appreciated very	much . I would however like to know why it is that ther is simply NO 	information out there on some subjects for the relativly novice graphics	programmer. The subjects are			1) How do you access the extra video memory on a video board. I	know somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you to	dothis. I have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the books	and info I have read I am only (at maximum) using 256k of it. There is a	way to do this in standard VGA cause I have seen vidoe paging (written in	assembly, which I don't know) written into apps hat use mode 13h. To get	any speed at all you have to do this. How do I do it?			2) The vesa standard. What gives here. I have read most of what	the net has to offer on VESA and as far as coding for VESA goes most of	the advice is cryptic at best. Where do I get public domain info that will	tell me in "mostly plain" english how the vesa calls work.			My biggest gripe is about number 1. I have bought graphics books,	I have asked graphics professors, I have hunted the net through both	gopher, and archie, I ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is	some lock on this information. Graphics programming books tell alot of	programmiing algorithm information, but they always fall short of telling	you how to really control the video bios. What are all the calls folks, I	know there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff. Where	are you, and why haven't you written a book yet?

What little they do see is from the view	given to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, 'hacker'	is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.		I, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who consider	themselves such.  Following is the definition from "Jargon File 2.9.10".	(This is also known as the "Hackers Dictionary".)  The definitions are	arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:		   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.	     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable	     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most	     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who	     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys	     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A	     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is	     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,	     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a UNIX	     hacker'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who	     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One	     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the	     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing	     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to	     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence 'password	     hacker', 'network hacker'.  See {cracker}.		     The term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global	     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and	     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described	     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see	     {hacker ethic, the}).		     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe	     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an	     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new	     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego	     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if	     you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled	     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.		   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing	     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of	     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and	     facilitating access to information and to computing resources	     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun	     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits	     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.		     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no	     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe	     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and	     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that	     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary	     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}	     project.		     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of	     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.	     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who	     see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On	     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy	     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,	     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it	     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an	     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.		     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker	     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share	     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing	     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as	     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})	     can function without central control because of this trait; they	     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be	     hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.			Note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing	limself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better	not to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'.  So,	in order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary	to borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the	workplace.  (This means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-known	and respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.			Language works anyway that we want it to work.  The purpose of language is	to communicate.  To oversimplify: As long as communication is taking place,	then language is working.		--	|================= #include <stddisclaimer.h> ================///=============|	| "AMIGA: The computer for the creative mind" (tm) Commodore /// Weber State  |	| "Macintosh: The computer for the rest of us"(tm) Apple \\\///   University  |	|== "I think, therefore I AMiga" -- val@csulx.weber.edu ==\///= Ogden UT USA =|

The best reason for ATM is that Adobe IS the standard.  Truetype is a	failed MS venture to undercut Adobe when Adobe was being nasty about	keeping their formats proprietary.
