\section*{WU1}
Two eigenvectors both pass through the origin, perpendicular to each other. However, depending on your random data, slopes will vary.

Figure \ref{fig:wu2} shows the normalized eigenvalues.
To account for 90\% variance, we have to include 82 eigenvectors.
To account for 95\% variance, we have to include 136 eigenvectors.

Figure \ref{fig:wu3} shows the plot of the top 50 eigenvectors. The majority of the results bear no resemblance to digits.
