The Observation vectors [1,1,1,2] and [2,1,1,2] are different in only one place
and lead to the outputs [0,0,0,1] and [1,1,1,1] that differ in more than one place.

\begin{verbatim}
   (a,b,pi) = datasets.getHMMData()
   print hmm.viterbi(array([1,1,1,2]), a, b, pi)    -> [0 0 0 1]
   print hmm.viterbi(array([2,1,1,2]), a, b, pi)    -> [1 1 1 1]

It seems to have hit a local maximum at the log probability -2.77259 since there was no increase in the log probabilities over 20 iterations)

With three states the log error decreases and the model is much more likely to produce the observed emissions.

With four states it does something akin to overfitting where it creates a transition matrix that perfectly fits the observed emissions. The log
probability that the observed sequence is generated by this model is 4.16334e-17 which basically means that it is impossible to create any other sequence.
It now perfectly emits the observation sequence but gets stuck in state 4 after the third transition and will continue to emit Wet with a very high probability. (95\%)
So it perfectly fits the observation but looses the ability to generalize.

It learned how likely certain letters appear and in what pairs of combinations they are likely to appear.

- It learned that \_,e,a,o,i and t,r,n,s are the most frequent letters. (This can be calculated by combining the emission probabilities
with the likelyhood of beeing in state 0 and\/or 1.)

-It learned that it is not likely for two blanks to appear after each other, but single blanks are very common.
You can see this by looking at the transition probabilities in combination with the emission probabilities. The model
emits a \_ with aprobability of ~37\% if it is in state 1 but only with 0.0014\% if it is in state 0. Since it is much more likely to transition from
state 1 to 0 than to stay in state 0 the combination of two \_ is not very likely. This matches with the observed text where double blanks don't appear at all.

- Similar to the blanks you can see that two vowels in a row are much less likely than other combinations and that words tend to start more often without vowels.

- The start state indicates that it also learned that the text is unlikely to start with a blank.

However with only two states the model cannot really emit the observed sequence anymore since it is much too general for that.
